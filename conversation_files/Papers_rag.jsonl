In order to predict the wanted or interfering signal, experts within the ITU-R have developed a number of propagation models for a range of scenarios and environments. These are continually being updated as new data becomes available \u2013 for example the model in Rec. ITU-R P.452 has just been revised to release 15. This White Paper looks at the differences between the main propagation models and their most recent releases.  Propagation Fundamentals Radio waves are governed by the four Maxwell Equations, discovered by the Scottish physicist of that name and published between 1861 and 1862. Despite being the foundation of our understanding of electromagnetics and optics, they are not often used directly in the prediction of radio waves due to the computation complexity involved. Hence it is usually necessary to make some simplifying assumptions or try to develop models that fit measured behaviour for specific conditions and scenarios. This allows them to be tuned and improved as more information is gathered.  So the propagation model to use will vary depending upon factors such as: \uf0b7 What is the path geometry? In particular is the path: o Between the Earth and space? o Along the surface of the Earth? o Between ground and air? \uf0b7 Are we considering the wanted signal (so might we worried about fading) or the interfering signal (so we might be worried about enhancements)? \uf0b7 Are we analysing a specific location or is this a general sharing study aimed at deriving generic conclusions? \uf0b7 What frequency bands are we considering?\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Can you explain what the Maxwell Equations are and their role in understanding radio waves?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Absolutely! The Maxwell Equations are a set of four differential equations discovered by James Clerk Maxwell that describe how electric and magnetic fields interact. They form the foundation of our current understanding of electromagnetism and optics.\n\nThese equations explain how charges create electric and magnetic fields, how these fields influence each other, and how they propagate through space as electromagnetic waves. One significant consequence of Maxwell's Equations is that they predict the existence of electromagnetic waves traveling through empty space at a specific speed: the speed of light.\n\n-- Radio Waves --\nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave, which can carry energy and information over long distances without requiring a physical medium like wires or cables. The Maxwell Equations help us understand how radio waves are generated and propagate in different environments.\n\nFor example, when an electric charge oscillates (vibrates) back and forth at the desired frequency, it generates an electromagnetic field that radiates outward as a wave. When such an oscillating charge is part of a transmitting antenna, this wave can be broadcast into space and potentially reach other receiving antennas, allowing for wireless communication to take place.\n\n-- Simplified Applications --\nHowever, it's important to note that the Maxwell Equations are quite complex mathematically, and their solutions require sophisticated computational methods. In many cases, scientists and engineers use simplifying assumptions or develop models based on experimental results when studying radio waves or other electromagnetic phenomena. This can make the analysis more manageable while still providing accurate predictions for most practical applications.\n\n-- Conclusion --\nIn summary, the Maxwell Equations provide the theoretical foundation for understanding electromagnetic waves such as radio waves. They describe how electric and magnetic fields interact with each other, how they propagate through space, and how oscillating charges generate electromagnetic radiation. The insights gained from these equations have led to a wide range of technological advancements, including wireless communication systems, antennas, and much more.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Maxwell Equations or radio waves?"}]}

Looking at the filing on the ITU\u2019s SNS it can be seen the frequencies used are in the following bands: Uplink:  27.5 \u2013 30.0 GHz Downlink: 17.8 \u2013 20.2 GHz In the ITU-R Radio Regulations these bands include a number of allocations and footnotes. For example footnote 5.523A, which relate to the bands 17.8 \u2013 19.3 / 28.6 \u2013 29.1 GHz, specifies that coordination is subject to RR 9.11A (i.e. coordination with priority by filing date). In other bands there are EPFD limits that must be met specified in RR Article 22. A number of interference paths can exist between O3B and GSO networks including: \u2022 From O3B uplink into GSO uplink \u2022 From O3B downlink into GSO downlink \u2022 From O3B downlink into GSO uplink \u2022 From GSO uplink into O3B uplink \u2022 From GSO downlink into O3B downlink \u2022 From GSO uplink into O3B downlink This raises a number of questions, such as: \u2022 Does the O3B network meet the EPFD(down), EPFD(up) and EPFD(IS) limits in RR Article 22? \u2022 Can the O3B network be coordinated with GSO networks in bands where EPFD does not apply? Modelling O3B To be able to answer these questions it is necessary to be able to model the O3B network within simulation tools.

The O3B network, operated by SES Networks, uses frequencies in the Ka band for its communications. Specifically, it employs 27.5-30.0 GHz for uplink and 17.8-20.2 GHz for downlink. These frequency bands are commonly used for satellite communication systems due to their ability to support high data rates over relatively short distances.\n\nHowever, when it comes to sharing the same spectrum with Geostationary Orbit (GSO) networks, potential interference paths can arise:\n\n* From O3B uplink into GSO uplink: An O3B satellite might interfere with a receiving GSO satellite if their beams overlap in space.\n* From O3B downlink into GSO downlink: Similarly, an O3B satellite might interfere with a ground station receiving signals from a GSO satellite if their beams overlap.\n* From O3B downlink into GSO uplink: Ground stations using the same frequency bands for both transmitting to and receiving from satellites may experience interference from the O3B network's downlink signals.\n* From GSO uplink into O3B uplink: A GSO satellite might interfere with an O3B satellite if their beams overlap in space.\n* From GSO downlink into O3B downlink: Ground stations using the same frequency bands for both transmitting to and receiving from satellites may experience interference from the GSO network's downlink signals.\n* From GSO uplink into O3B downlink: An uplink station attempting to communicate with a GSO satellite might interfere with a ground station receiving signals from an O3B satellite if their beams overlap.\n\nIt is essential for satellite operators, such as SES Networks, to employ frequency reuse strategies and interference mitigation techniques to minimize these potential sources of interference. These methods can include frequency planning, beamforming, and adaptive modulation schemes. Do you have any questions about the potential interference paths or strategies for managing them?"}]}

In particular, if a BS is deployed with a specific geometry it will be fixed for all time.  For example, consider an interfering path from BS to victim satellite ES and the two geometries shown below: Geometry 1: BS pointing away from ES and clutter between BS and ES  UE BS Clutter between BS and ES Victim ES 3 | P a g e    Email us at info@transfinite.com for further information or to give your views on this Technical Note Geometry 2: BS pointing towards the ES and line of sight between BS and ES:  In the first case there is clutter loss between the BS and the ES and at 26 GHz this is likely to represent a significant attenuation of the interfering signal. In the second case there is direct line of sight between the BS and the ES and so the interfering signal will be much stronger. As the BS deployment is static this can result in significant variation in the levels of interference. In both cases there would be time variation (e.g. due to traffic, other propagation effects and UE location) but there would be a significant difference in the CDF of the I/N at the ES. The approach to take depends upon the relative distance from the nearest BS to the ES: \uf0b7 If there is a short distance between the nearest BS and the ES or small number of interferers, then the aggregate interference could be driven by a single interferer and hence the deployment of that particular station will be key.  In this case it might be better to define a set of specific scenarios that model the environment around the ES, for the reality is that results will be dependent upon the deployment geometry. \uf0b7 If there is a large distance between the nearest BS and the ES and large numbers of interferers, then there is likely to be a greater difference between the\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hi there, I have a question regarding satellite communications. How can deploying a Base Station (BS) with a specific geometry impact interference in satellite communications?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Hello! Satellite communications can be affected by various sources of interference, one of which is terrestrial stations like Base Stations (BS). The way a BS is deployed geographically can significantly influence the levels of interference it causes to victim satellites. Let me explain with an example.\n\nIf the BS is pointing away from the satellite and there is a significant amount of clutter, such as other buildings or terrain features, between them, the interfering signal will be attenuated due to the clutter loss. Clutter loss is the reduction in power received by a satellite caused by obstructive objects in the line of sight, like trees, buildings, or other structures. The presence of these obstructions causes the signal to scatter, resulting in a decrease in received power and, therefore, less interference.\n\nOn the other hand, if the BS is pointing directly towards the satellite and there is a clear line of sight between them, the interfering signal will be much stronger due to the absence of clutter loss. In this case, the signal from the BS may completely drown out the weaker satellite signal, causing significant interference or even degradation of the communications link.\n\nSince BS deployments are usually static and not easily moved, these variations in interference caused by the geometry can lead to long-term changes in the levels of interference experienced by the victim satellite. Therefore, it's crucial to consider the impact on satellite communications when planning the deployment of new terrestrial stations like BS.\n\nDoes this answer your question?

The location of the Earth Station relative to the satellite is important only in that it  determines the pointing angles of the antenna, and the results are dependent mainly on elevation angle. The fine details of the results are also dependent on the azimuth, but, given the Monte-Carlo elements we have introduced, the overall character of the results and conclusions are insensitive to azimuth.  We expect results to be worse for lower elevation antennas, where a number of IMT stations could be seen at higher gain values.  The 5\u00b0 used is the operational minimum for FSS in C-band.

Overview A D2D constellation consists of two main elements: \u2022 Space segment: this involves a constellation of hundreds or even thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit.

Designing the Non-GSO Constellation Two key attributes will impact the performance of a given non-GSO constellation to provide D2D services: 1) The coverage statistics of the constellation 2) The link budgets between the satellite and the UE. These two are related and connected to the constellation configuration, and in particular the orbit altitude, with some of the benefits and costs as in the table below:  Costs Benefits Lower altitude More satellites = more capital expenditure Increased orbit drag / lower satellite lifetime Lower latency Lower path length = better C/N for a given transmit power or less power required Higher altitude Higher latency Longer path length = worse C/N for a given transmit power or increased power required  Few satellites = lower capital expenditure Lower orbit drag / longer satellite lifetime Some of the problems of lower C/N for higher altitude satellites can be overcome by more complicated and larger satellites, but with consequential cost implications.

Choice of \n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I've been looking into designing a non-GSO constellation for providing D2D services. Could you explain how the choice of orbit altitude impacts the design?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Certainly! The altitude of a satellite orbit significantly influences the design of a non-geostationary orbit (GSO) constellation in several ways, particularly with respect to coverage statistics and link budgets between the satellite and user equipment. Let me explain.\n\nOrbit altitude determines the satellite's ground track and its velocity relative to the Earth. A lower orbit will have a smaller coverage footprint, meaning fewer users can be served at any one time; but it also offers faster ground speeds, providing more frequent handovers between satellites and, in turn, better connectivity for mobile terminals. Conversely, higher orbits offer larger coverage areas but slower ground speeds, making them suitable for fixed satellite services (FSS) where mobility is not an issue.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the link budget between the satellite and user equipment. A lower orbit provides a stronger signal due to the shorter distance between the satellite and users on the ground; however, it may require more satellites in the constellation for full coverage and redundancy. On the other hand, higher orbits have weaker signals but cover larger areas and require fewer satellites.\n\nThere are trade-offs involved when choosing an orbit altitude for a non-GSO constellation. Lower orbits may be more expensive due to the need for more satellites, but they offer faster ground speeds and better connectivity for mobile applications. Higher orbits, on the other hand, cover larger areas with fewer satellites, but their weaker signals require more advanced user equipment and may not be as suitable for mobile applications.\n\nIn practice, designing a non-GSO constellation often involves iterating through different orbit altitudes, considering trade-offs such as coverage area, cost, satellite count, link budgets, and ground speeds to find an optimal solution for the specific use case. Do you have any further questions about how the choice of orbit altitude impacts the design of a non-GSO constellation?"}]}

One approach is to switch off or change the operational mode of one or both satellites when they come into \"inline geometry,\" which means their orbital planes and positions are very close to each other, increasing the likelihood of interference.\n\nAnother method involves managing the orbits of the satellites to ensure they are not synchronized and avoid overlapping coverage areas. This can be achieved by adjusting the inclination, altitude, or eccentricity of their orbits.\n\nFurthermore, different polarizations can be used for each satellite's signals to minimize interference. Polarization refers to the direction in which an electromagnetic wave oscillates as it travels through space. By using orthogonal (perpendicular) polarizations, the two systems can transmit and receive their signals without significant interference.\n\nLastly, operating on different frequencies is another way to reduce interference between satellite systems. Each system can use a unique frequency band for its transmissions, allowing them to coexist in the same orbital space while minimizing the impact of interference. This also enables better utilization of the radio spectrum and avoids potential conflicts with terrestrial communications.\n\nDo you have any additional questions related to satellite systems or reducing interference between them?"}]}

For example consider the two coverage plots below:  TX antenna above clutter using P.1546 at VHF 4 | P a g e    Email us at info@transfinite.com for further information or to give your views on this White Paper  TX antenna above clutter using P.1812 at VHF The motivation for P.1546 and P.1812 are similar but as can be seen here they can give very different results with the same inputs.  The key difference here is that P.1546 only makes partial use of the terrain data while P.1812 goes into greater detail.  How propagation models take account of terrain \u2013 and clutter data \u2013 is a key distinguisher, as described in the following section. Terrain, Clutter & Surface Databases When a terrain database is available it can be used to create a path profile.  The usual approach is to create a great circle line from the transmitter to the receiver, then calculate the height at fixed distances between them as in the figure below. Grid of Terrain Points Path from TX to RX Stations  Extraction of Path Profile The spot height calculation takes account of the terrain database\u2019s surrounding four points using methods such as linear interpolation. The resulting path profile will look something like this:  Extracted Terrain Path Profile In addition to terrain data there can also be land use databases. These tend to have a code for each location pixel that is mapped onto environment types such as: \uf0b7 Dense urban \uf0b7 Urban \uf0b7 Suburban \uf0b7 Sea \uf0b7 Wood The land use codes are used to calculate the clutter loss at the transmit and receive station (P.452, P.1812 and P.2001) or just the receive station (P.1546). However P.1812 also uses the clutter code to adjust the path profile by adding the height of the clutter to the path profile as in the figure below.

Could you explain how one is extracted using a terrain database?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Of course! To extract a path profile using a terrain database, the first step is to determine a great circle line between the transmitter and receiver stations. A great circle line is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, such as the Earth. Once this line has been established, we can then calculate the height at fixed distances along this line.\n\nThe method for calculating the height at each point along the line often involves using interpolation techniques based on the surrounding terrain data in the database. Interpolation is a mathematical technique used to estimate values between known data points. In this case, we use the heights of the four closest terrain points in the database to estimate the height at the desired location on the great circle line. This results in an extracted terrain path profile that provides the height information along the shortest route between the two stations.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful!

The screen shot below shows analysis of sharing between a non-GSO constellation defined via its TLE orbit parameters and aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT).  Mask Integration and Frequency View An important part of managing the radio spectrum is to analyse interference from systems in adjacent bands.  This can be complicated due to the need to calculate the Net Filter Discrimination (NFD) between one systems\u2019s transmit spectrum mask and the other\u2019s receive filter. However Visualyse Professional Version 7 can make this simple, automatically and accurately integrating the two masks to derive a NFD. It can also show the two masks graphically in the new frequency view, as in the example below.

This can be done in a number of ways, including: \u2022 Having short-term and long-term I or I/N thresholds \u2022 Impact of interference on unavailability \u2022 Impact of interference on throughput. Examples of defining short-term and long-term interference thresholds can be found in a number of ITU-R Recommendations. An example of this would be those in Recommendation ITU- SA.1027-6: Sharing criteria for space-to-Earth data transmission systems in the Earth exploration-satellite and meteorological-satellite services using satellites in low-Earth orbit, as in the table below: RSL = minimum C to provide required C/(N+I) Ctarget = target unfaded C N+Iagg = noise plus interference N = receiver noise Iagg = aggregate interference I = single entry interference MI = Interference margin Iagg/N I/N T(C/(N+I)) = threshold C/(N+I) Mfade = Fade margin Ms = System margin 12 | P a g e    Email us at info@transfinite.com for further information or to give your views on this White Paper  These are based upon aggregate interference thresholds in Recommendation ITU-R SA.1026, using apportionment based upon division in time for the short-term and power for the long-term. An example of using unavailability and throughput is given in Article 22.5L which gives the following criteria for non- GSO systems causing interference into GSO networks in Q/V band using the methodology in Resolution 770: \u2022 a single-entry increase of 3% of the time allowance for the C/N value associated with the shortest percentage of time specified in the short-term performance objective of the generic geostationary-satellite orbit reference links; and \u2022 a single-entry permissible allowance of at most 3% reduction in time-weighted average spectral efficiency calculated on an annual basis for the generic geostationary-satellite orbit reference links using adaptive coding\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hello there! I'm working on a project related to satellite communications, and I have a few questions regarding interference in link budget calculations. Specifically, I was wondering if you could explain how interference is typically accounted for in these calculations?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Certainly! Interference can significantly impact the performance of satellite communications systems, so it's important to include it in link budget calculations. There are a few ways this is typically done.\n\nOne approach is to have both short-term and long-term interference thresholds. Short-term thresholds refer to the immediate impact of interference on signal quality, while long-term thresholds consider the average effect of interference over longer periods. The specific values for these thresholds will depend on the satellite communication system being used and the regulatory requirements.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the impact of interference on unavailability and throughput. Unavailability refers to the time during which a communication link is not available, while throughput measures the amount of data that can be transmitted over the link per unit time. By calculating the impact of interference on these two metrics, you can get a better understanding of how it affects the overall performance of your satellite communications system."}, {"from": "human", "value": "That's interesting. I've heard of Article 22.5L before, and it seems to address this topic in the context of non-GSO systems interfering with GSO networks in Q/V band. Could you explain what criteria this article gives for such interference?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Sure! According to Article 22.5L, a single-entry increase of 3% of the time allowance for the C/N value associated with the shortest percentage of time specified in the short-term performance objective of the generic geostationary-satellite orbit reference links is permissible for non-GSO systems causing interference into GSO networks in Q/V band. Additionally, a single-entry permissible allowance of at most 3% reduction in time-weighted average spectral efficiency calculated on an annual basis for the generic geostationary-satellite orbit reference links using adaptive coding is allowed. These criteria are set to maintain a minimum level of performance for the GSO networks despite potential interference from non-GSO systems. However, it's important to note that specific applications and regions may have different requirements or more stringent thresholds."}]}

The technical work is summarised in the CPM Report, finalised at the CPM-2 meeting to be held in Geneva 23rd March to 2nd April 2015. Over the last few years, thousands of input contributions have been submitted to the ITU-R\u2019s Working Parties and Study Groups \u2013 and in this White Paper we describe how many of these were produced using Transfinite\u2019s Visualyse Professional radio modelling tool, launched at WRC 95.  CPM and WRC WRC 2012 set the scene for 3 years of work at the ITU- R that will culminate in November when thousands of delegates head to Geneva to negotiate an update to the Radio Regulations (RR). The RR defines what services can operate in which bands and specifies what constraints they should be subject to. As the radio spectrum gets ever busier, there are more and more services looking to access the same key frequencies.  The World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC) is the critical meeting where decisions are made, locked into the RR which have the status of a treaty document. So the pressure is on to make the right decisions and so it is key that all delegates are well informed. Over the last few years there have been thousands of studies in the many ITU-R Study Groups and Working Parties. The results and findings have been distilled into the draft Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM) Report. At the CPM this draft will be discussed and finalised, ready to be the prime technical input into the WRC. The CPM Report is split into Chapters reflecting the services, in particular: Chapter 1: Mobile and Amateur issues Chapter 2: Science issues Chapter 3: Aeronau\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hi there! Could you tell me about the World Radiocommunications Conference? What's its purpose?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help answer that question. The World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC) is an international telecommunication conference organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Its primary goal is to make decisions regarding which radio services can operate in specific frequency bands and what restrictions or conditions they must adhere to. These decisions are made through negotiations among representatives from ITU member countries, satellite organizations, and international entities. The WRC outcomes are documented as part of the Radio Regulations (RR), which have the status of a treaty document. Essentially, it's a platform for governments and other organizations to come together to discuss and agree on how to best use the radio frequency spectrum for various communication services."}, {"from": "human", "value": "So it helps manage and allocate the use of radio frequencies for different applications?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yes, exactly! The World Radiocommunications Conference plays a crucial role in managing and allocating radio frequencies for different applications and services, ensuring that they can coexist without causing harmful interference with one another. It's an important event in the telecommunications industry as it sets the stage for future developments in various fields such as wireless communications, broadcasting, satellite services, and more."}]}
