Could you tell me how it determines what constitutes \"co-frequency\" and \"non-co-frequency\"?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The IMT-MODEL antenna is a specific type of antenna, and its gain pattern is determined by several parameters. When it comes to co-frequency and non-co-frequency, the definition is set via two main parameters: Centre Frequency and Co-Frequency Bandwidth.\n\nTo be more specific, the Centre Frequency is the centre frequency that the antenna has been tuned to. This is essentially the primary operating frequency of the antenna. On the other hand, the Co-Frequency Bandwidth defines the total bandwidth that is considered co-frequency. This means any frequencies within this bandwidth range are also treated as being on the same frequency band.\n\nSo, in essence, if a signal falls within the specified Co-Frequency Bandwidth range, it's considered co-frequency; otherwise, it's classified as non-co-frequency. Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about IMT-MODEL or antennas in general?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Actually, yes, I do have another question.

Elevation refers to the angle above or below the horizon that the antenna is aimed.\n\nBy specifying these values, you can ensure that your antenna remains pointed in a fixed direction for the duration of the run.

The Optimize is used to minimize or maximize a parameter, subject to the variation of a second parameter. 2.5.2.1 Solve For The Solver can be used to change the value of an object attribute that is dependent on another object attribute. Ordinarily, the only way to change an attribute of this kind is to keep changing the attribute on which it depends until you achieve the desired result. The Solver takes over this trial and error process and does all the hard work for you. For example, say you had an Earth station communicating with a geostationary satellite. Your problem might be that the satellite should be positioned such that the relative gain at the Earth Station is 2 degrees down from main beam.  You can use the Solver to find the longitude position for the satellite which achieves the requirements for relative gain at the Earth station. 2.5.2.2 Optimize The Optimizer is used to maximize or minimize the value of an object attribute that is dependent on another object attribute.

Visualyse Professional has been designed to simulate radio systems and to analyse potential interference between such systems. Visualyse will allow you to faithfully model many types of radio system and provides support for the definition of terrestrial networks, space based systems, radar, fixed and mobile communications. User Guide  Page 7    Its range of built-in antenna and propagation models means that most of the time the elements needed to model your system, even if the systems as a whole is innovating and new, are already there and you simply pick them from list. Increasingly we find that people are using Visualyse for other types of modelling, and this is possible due to the open and flexible design of the software. Visualyse can be used for many other types of analysis, and users are supported in this by the graphical feedback, the possibility to track and analyse internal variables and the simple underlying model that the software uses. Graphical Feedback An important feature of Visualyse is the graphical interface and the animated interactive views. The feedback from these views allows complex simulations to be set-up and more easily verified. You will see immediately if you create a station or a link and it is not in the location you intended. The dynamics of your scenario can be displayed on a variety of map projections.  Graphs showing the evolution of any variable or statistical information on any variable are also interactively updated. Not a Black Box Engineering software is often presented as a black box system.

All three types of graph are produced using software provided by Graphics Server. Many configuration options are provided via the Graph Control, which is described in detail in the section 5.2.2.5. 1.1.5 How to Create and Change Things in Visualyse Objects are created and changed in Visualyse via dialogs. Each dialog consists of a number of sheets (or tabs) via which the relevant parameters are entered.  There are a number of ways to access the dialogs: Via the toolbar \u2013 for example, clicking the Station icon will bring up the Station List. This shows all the Stations in the current simulation, and gives options to Add, Edit, Duplicate and Delete.  Via the menus \u2013 element lists can all be accessed from the Model menu.

The effect is to reduce the interfering carrier level or (equivalently the wanted receiver response) by a number of dBs at each defined frequency off-set. This could be used, for example, to model the out of band interference of a narrow band carrier into a wide band receiver with a known filter characteristic. The filter characteristic would be reflected in the off-set advantage. Details of the effect on the interference calculation are given in the Technical Annex.

In an orbital system, the apogee location and longitude are important parameters that define specific characteristics of a satellite's orbit.\n\nThe apogee location defines the highest point of the orbit, where satellites move more slowly at higher altitude. This is in contrast to the perigee, which is the closest point to the Earth. By defining the apogee location, you can understand the shape and size of the orbital path.\n\nRegarding longitude, it's essential because it determines the point on the Earth above which the apogee will occur. In other words, it tells us where exactly along the satellite's orbit this highest point is positioned.\n\nThese parameters are used to create a single ground track for each plane in the system. This helps with tracking and predicting the satellite's path over time, which is crucial for various applications like navigation, telecommunications, or space exploration.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to clarify about orbital systems?"}]}

User Guide  Page 14    2 Overview of Visualyse Professional This section describes the way the structure of Visualyse relates to real world radiocommunications systems, their operation and their compatibility.  Before we discuss the ways in which systems can be built, we need to say a few words about the settings that define the environment in which the systems will operate (chiefly which propagation models you want to use) and settings that tell Visualyse what outputs you are interested in.  These should be considered before you start to model your systems, but can be changed at any point before you start to run the simulation. The purpose of the discussion below is to make you aware of the options that are available. 2.1 Propagation Modelling The Propagation menu determines the global default settings for the propagation environments.  As Visualyse allows you to look at compatibility between fundamentally different types of system, there are often times when one single set of models cannot be applied to all links in simulation.

The structure of the software underlying Visualyse is based on an object-oriented analysis of radiocommunications systems and interference analysis. The objects and the relationships between objects will seem familiar to most engineers.  However, there may be some differences between the Visualyse model and your model of the world of radiocommunications. It is important that the exact structure of the software is understood if you are to gain maximum benefit from the tool.

An example use of this option would be if many interfering Links have been entered with different frequencies according to some channel plan, and a worst- case analysis is required. The worst-case analysis may not include the channel plan. Forcing co-frequency would allow the existing Links to be used without losing the channel plan data. This option should not really be used to scale systems from, say C-band to Ku-band. The adjustment is only applied when the bandwidth overlap factor is calculated.

In the real world stations use antennas and so Visualyse has an Antenna object to model the behaviour of antennas. A Station in Visualyse is defined by a location, rules for its movement and the antennas it uses and how it points them. Links can be defined by a start and end Station and include details of EIRP, Frequency and each has a specified Carrier.  Having defined the basic modelling elements, Links can then be selected as wanted or interfering (or both), and this reflects our experience of how spectrum sharing and interference analysis studies are conceptualised. Antennas, Carriers, Stations and Links contain almost all the information needed to perform interference calculations. Stations and Links can be placed into Groups e.g. satellite constellations can be treated as a single Group of Stations, multiple uplinks to a single satellite can be treated as a Group of Links. Analysis of Groups of Stations and Links allows large scenarios to be analysed more easily. 1.1.2.2 Define the Required Output Interference can be analysed in terms of: \u2022 C \u2013 the wanted carrier level \u2022 I \u2013 the interfering carrier level \u2022 N \u2013 the wanted system noise \u2022 C/I \u2022 C/N \u2022 C/N+I \u2022 I/N \u2022 PFD \u2013 the Power Flux Density  \u2022 EPFD \u2013 the Equivalent Power Flux Density Interference can be from a single source or aggregated from multiple antennas on multiple Stations.

However, because they maintain a roughly fixed position above the earth, we don\u2019t need to define them by the classical orbit elements and can specify their position in a simpler way.   GSO Orbit Characteristics For most GSO work, only the longitude and inclination angle are required. For more advanced modelling, click the \u201cMore orbital elements\u201d button. This will open the GSO orbital elements dialog. This allows you to specify the eccentricity, and phase in e and i. User Guide  Page 76     GSO orbital elements Phase in e (eccentricity) and Phase in i (inclination) relate to orbital anomaly (see the Technical Annex). Phase in e tells you how far from the apogee the satellite is at and Phase in i how far it is from maximum inclination \u2013 when the satellite was created. These parameters can have a dramatic effect on the ground track of satellite that is not in exactly circular orbit. 3.3 Station Groups Station Groups are introduced in Visualyse Professional to make large simulations more manageable and understandable.

They can be used in any situation where there is choice \u2013 most typically because in the dynamic simulation the relative positions of the various stations are changing. Examples include: User Guide  Page 138    \u2022 Terrestrial mobile network: a mobile selects the base station to use as it moves (for example along pre-defined route or with its location randomised) \u2022 Non-GSO network: an Earth Station will use a different one as the satellites fly overhead \u2022 Aeronautical telemetry: as the aircraft moves it will select a different control station to communicate with \u2022 Maritime voice: as the ship moves it will switch to a different coastal station A key factor here is there is one station that must select the end station of the Dynamic Link from a set of possible candidates. The Tracking Strategy is used to make that selection. Consider the example simulation below:  Tracking Strategy Example In this case a maritime station has a choice of ten possible satellites to communicate with. Some will be clearly unsuitable \u2013 such as those below the horizon as seen by the ship. Hence there are rules that can be geometric that can be used to identify unsuitable candidates. In this case a simple rule could be used: Elevation angle of the satellite as seen by the ship should be at least 0\uf0b0 This is sufficient for this example as ships in open water can see down to very low elevations. In other circumstances the rules might have to be much more complicated. In addition, there can be multiple candidates that all meet this minimal rule: in this case there are three satellites visible to the ship. \n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Hi, I've been reading about Visualyse Professional and its associated protocols, but I'm still trying to understand the concept of Tracking Strategies.

In general terms, a Tracking Strategy is a protocol or approach used in specific contexts where certain types of data need to be tracked and updated in real-time.

For instance, if the mobile is traveling along a pre-defined route or with its location randomized.\n\nIn this scenario, the Tracking Strategy would help to dynamically update the mobile's association with nearby base stations based on its movement and changing location. This can be useful for maintaining optimal network performance, minimizing latency, and ensuring seamless connectivity as the device moves through different areas of coverage.\n\nThis is just one potential example, but the concept of a Tracking Strategy could apply in various other contexts depending on specific requirements and use cases.

The only difference is the dialog name and the default icon (an Earth Station). 3.2.2.4 Mobile Stations Mobile Stations are the same as Terrestrial Fixed Stations except that they can move around. The position tab allows you to set the start location and how the Station moves from that start location. User Guide  Page 72     Mobile Station Position Tab Heading can be changed by typing a value in the box. The angle control next to the box indicates the angle that has been entered. By clicking and dragging in the angle control itself, you can also set the heading. Note here that this simple motion can be over-ridden by using the Define Variable module, which allows you complete control over the location of the station throughout a simulation. This module also allows you to vary parameters randomly and hence perform Monte-Carlo simulations (see the Modules User Guide) 3.2\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "I'm working with the Station dialog in Visualyse Professional which I use to simulate orbital mechanics, and I've come across position and velocity vector components.

This User Guide provides all the information you need to operate the software.  In other documents you will find the User Guide for the add-on Modules, a Tutorial, a Technical Annex giving background to the calculations, and a description of each of the example files. Our assumptions about you, the User are that you are an engineer of some kind and that your understanding of radio systems and interference issues is good. We assume that you are mainly looking for guidance on the operation of the software. Therefore the main aim of this Guide is to show you how to map your real world understanding onto the abstract models and concepts in Visualyse. This is relatively easy to do as the concepts and models in Visualyse are based on our analysis of the real world of radiocommunications, and we anticipate significant overlap between our world and yours. We recommend that you read at least the overview section thoroughly. Other sections of this User Guide can be used as reference books when you are building and editing your simulations. If you are a typical user you will be able to make some good progress by experimenting with the software itself \u2013 perhaps after having followed the Tutorial.
