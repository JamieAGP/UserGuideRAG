Update sequence 
This section describes the series of steps Visualyse Professional uses to update 
the simulation at each time step. This well-defined procedure ensures the results 
generated by Visualyse Professional are always consistent with the input 
parameters selected. 
The process is as follows: 
1. 
Update the current time using time step information 
2. 
Set the random number seed for this time step 
3. 
Update all the define variables 
4. 
Update all the positions of the stations 
5. 
Update the pointing of each antenna (except if pointing by link) 
6. 
Update all links including: 
i. Calculating the traffic profile for this link for this time 
step 
ii. Selecting the station, antenna, beam to use for 
dynamic links 
iii. Updating the pointing of any antenna that uses pointing 
by link 
iv. Calculating the wanted signal level 
v. Updating the wanted signal calculation if using power 
control 
7. 
Updating all interference paths 
8. 
Updating all link groups 
9. 
Update all statistics 
10. 
Updating all views and outputting to file any information 
requested to be logged

Coordination systems 
This section defines the coordinate systems used for each type of station and 
within antennas and beams. 
3.1 
ECI Vectors 
All stations in Visualyse Professional are located in Earth Centred Inertial (ECI) 
coordinate system using position and velocity vectors of the form: 
r
x
y
z
=










 
The co-ordinate system is defined as follows: 
X axis: aligned with the vernal equinox as described further below 
Z axis: aligned with the North Pole 
Y axis: at right angles to the X and Z axes, using right handed co-
ordinate system 
The X axis of the ECI system is oriented in relation to the earth using the first 
point of Aries at the following epoch: 
 
At: 
00:00 hours on the 1st January 1970 
 
g0 =  100229421 
This is shown in the figure below:

Where:

Lat = Latitude of the station 
g = the conversion of the longitude in the rotating Earth frame to angle 
with respect to the X axis. 
Stations with non-zero speed will have their (latitude, longitude, heights) 
updated assuming they take great circle paths over a spherical Earth.

3.3.3 
Orbit Conversions 
Some orbits are defined using other parameters, such as apogee / perigee 
height or radii. These can be converted into the standard set above using the 
following equations. 
3.3.3.1 Elliptical orbit shape 
The apogee / perigee heights / radius’s can be converted using: 
 
Apogee conversion: Ra = Re + ha 
 
Perigee conversion: Rp = Re + hp 
Re is the Earth’s radius of 6378.1 km. 
Then the semi major axis and eccentricity are: 
 
Ra = a(1 + e) 
 
Rp = a(1 - e) 
So: 
 
a = (Ra + Rp)/2 
 
e = (Ra - Rp)/( Ra + Rp) 
3.3.3.2 Anomaly Angle 
There are a number of ways of defining where the satellite is in the orbit plane 
with respect to the perigee, including 
 = true anomaly 
E = eccentric anomaly

3.4 
Station Coordinate Systems 
The coordinate system used by the station defines how the antennas are 
pointed and varies between station types. 
3.4.1 
Calculation of Azimuth and Elevation 
For each station type an intermediate local set of orthogonal vectors, (X’, Y’, Z’) 
are generated. From these the azimuth and elevation are calculated as follows: 
X’
Y’
Z’
Observer
Azimuth
Elevation
 
Figure 3. Azimuth, Elevation, Range 
To define the coordinate system for each station type it is therefore necessary to 
define the (X’, Y’, Z’) vectors in each case. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 14 
 
 
 
An alternative way of considering it is that for an observer, the azimuth is the 
angle in the horizontal plane with the line directly ahead, with the right hand 
being positive, whilst the elevation is the angle in the vertical plane compared to 
the horizon, with up being positive. 
3.4.2 
Fixed Stations 
For stations at fixed locations, whether Earth, terrestrial, mobile, maritime or 
aeronautical stations, the azimuth and elevations are derived using the north, 
east and zenith vectors as shown in the figure below: 
Z
X
Y
N
Z
E
R
 
Figure 4. Earth / Terrestrial station co-ordinate system 
These are mapped onto the generic local vectors as follows: 
X’ = E 
Y’ = N 
Z’ = Z 
The result is the traditional alignment of: 
• 
Azimuth = angle in the horizontal plane from due North increasing in a 
clockwise direction, defined within the range (-180 to +180) 
• 
Elevation = angle above the horizontal plane 
3.4.3 
Non Geostationary Satellites 
For satellites the coordinate system is based upon the line to the centre of the 
Earth (i.e. towards the sub-satellite point) and the velocity vector, so that for 
circular orbits: 
X’ = Q = vector at right angles to velocity and position vectors 
Y’ = P = -R 
Z’ = V 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 15 
 
 
 
The P and Q vectors are shown in the figure below.

Q
 
Figure 1: Definition of Satellite Coordinate System 
Another way of looking at it is to consider the view from the satellite looking 
down at the sub-satellite point, head pointing in the direction of the velocity 
vector – the “superhero” position. In this case as in the figure below: 
Velocity 
vector
Sub-satellite 
point
Elevation 
up/down
Azimuth 
left/right
 
Figure 2: Visualisation of Satellite Coordinate System 
• 
Azimuth = to left and right of the sub-satellite point, where right is 
positive 
• 
Elevation = up and down, where up is positive 
This coordinate system assumes that the radius vector and velocity vector are at 
right angles which will only be the case for circular orbits. For elliptical orbits it is 
necessary to select which vector of (R, V) the coordinate system will align with. 
3.4.4 
Geostationary Satellites 
For satellites the coordinate system is based upon the line to the centre of the 
Earth (i.e. towards the sub-satellite point), the north vector, and the velocity 
vector, so that:

Figure 3: Coordinate System for Geostationary Satellites 
In formal terms, for a GSO satellite: 
X’ = V 
Y’ = -R 
Z’ = N 
3.4.5 
Moving Stations 
Moving stations can use either of the coordinate systems describe above: 
• 
North based, as for terrestrial stations 
• 
Velocity based, as for non-GSO satellites. 
Additional coordinate frames can be created by utilising the orientation (or Euler) 
angles (pitch, roll, yaw) which define how the antenna platform is located with 
respect to the station coordination scheme. 
For example consider an aircraft, when the orientation is velocity based, where 
the following Euler angles have been set: 
 
Pitch = 90º 
 
Roll = 0º 
 
Yaw = 0º 
This will rotate the az/el = (0, 0) line from the line from the station to the centre of 
the Earth to the direction of motion. Having done this the azimuth angle is similar 
to yaw while elevation angle similar to pitch, as in the figure below using a ship 
as an example:

Elevation
 
Figure 4: Elevation and Azimuth for Moving Ships 
A similar coordinate system can be used for aircraft. 
Note that if the aircraft is pitching up or down the velocity vector will not be at 
right angles to the position vector. Hence the coordinate frame will have to 
choose which to align with. 
To create a coordinate system in which the reference az/el = (0, 0) remains the 
nose of the aircraft even when pitching up or down the following settings should 
be used: 
Coordinate System: 
 
Velocity based = true 
 
Align with velocity vector = true 
 
Pitch = 90º 
 
Roll = 0º 
 
Yaw = 0º 
3.5 
Station, Antenna and Beam Coordinate Systems 
A station can contain multiple antennas which can contain multiple beams. Each 
can have its own pointing angles – so for example there can be: 
• 
Pointing angles of antenna with respect to station’s coordinate system 
(these are the azimuth, elevation of the antenna in the station dialog) 
• 
Pointing angles of beam with respect to antenna’s coordinate system 
(these are the azimuth, elevation of the beam in the antenna dialog) 
In addition there can also be: 
• 
Pointing angles of antenna platform with respect to station (these are the 
orientation angles on the station dialog’s advanced tab) 
These angles are combined together in the following order from inertial ECI 
vectors: 
• 
From ECI to (azimuth, elevation) in station coordinate system using 
definition of (X’, Y’, Z’) in previous section 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 18 
 
 
 
• 
From station coordinate (azimuth, elevation) to antenna platform 
(azimuth, elevation) using orientation angles (yaw, pitch, roll) 
• 
From antenna platform (azimuth, elevation) to a specific antenna’s 
(azimuth, elevation) using the antenna’s az/el pointing angles 
• 
From an antenna’s (azimuth, elevation) to a beam’s (azimuth, elevation) 
using the beam’s az/el pointing angles 
3.6 
Slice Angle 
This section describes the definition of the slice angle which is used within 
Visualyse Professional to display gain patterns. 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Gain Geometry 
For many antennas, such as those using parabolic reflectors, the gain pattern is 
symmetric around the boresight. The gain pattern can therefore be displayed in 
a graph as gain vs offaxis angle – for example the pattern below is 
Recommendation ITU-R Rec. S.465 for a 2.4m dish at 3.6 GHz: 
 
Other antennas do not have this symmetry: for example the patterns of a base 
station antenna are likely to vary in both azimuth and elevation, and hence are 
described as 3D patterns. 
For these antennas the gain pattern taken in the azimuth and elevation 
directions are likely to be different, and we call these different directions “slices”. 
The slices are taken in planes that intersect the boresight line (see figure at top). 
Elevation = +90
Antenna
Boresight
Azimuth = -90
Azimuth = +90
f = 0
f = 90
Slice angle f = angle to the 
elevation = 0 plane
Elevation = 0 plane

Technical Annex 
 
Page 19 
 
 
 
The orientation of the slice is defined by the slice angle or f, which is the angle 
of the slice plane to the elevation = 0 plane. Hence the f = 0 slice is the gain 
pattern in the azimuth plane while the f = 90 slice is the gain pattern in the 
elevation plane. 
Rather than showing offaxis angle along the X axis of the gain plot, the slice 
instead shows the angle from the boresight line, shown in the figure above as . 
Any slice angle can be selected from 0 to 180 and it will define a plane and 
hence create a separate gain pattern. As all slices intersect the boresight line all 
will start with the  = 0 point which is the boresight, usually, but not always, 
defined as the point in the 3D gain pattern with highest gain value. 
For example the figures below show two slices from the same 3D gain pattern 
and hence start with  = 0 where the gain = 18 dBi. 
 
Slice angle = 0 (azimuth plane) 
 
Slice angle = 90 (elevation plane) 
Note that azimuth and elevation in this figure are relative to the gain pattern’s 
boresight and there could be a variety of orientation angles including: 
• 
Beam within the Antenna Type 
• 
Antenna with respect to the Antenna Platform 
• 
Antenna Platform with respect to the Station 
Note also there are a variety of Station orientations as described in the previous 
sections.

Link Budget Calculations 
4.1 
Power Calculation Reference Points 
In order to be able to model a wide range of radio systems a generic link model 
is used in all calculations in Visualyse Professional. The basic link budget is as 
follows: 
 
CRX = PTX + GPeakTX +GRelTX – LP + GPeakRX + GRelRX – LRX 
Where: 
 
PTX = transmit power at input to antenna (dBW) 
 
GPeakTX = transmit antenna peak gain (dBi) 
 
GRelTX = transmit antenna gain towards the receiver relative to peak (dB) 
 
LP = propagation loss between transmit and receive antennas (dB) 
 
GPeakRX = receive antenna peak gain (dBi) 
 
GRelRX = receive antenna gain towards the transmitter relative to peak (dB) 
 
LRX = losses between receive antenna and input to the receiver (dB) 
The reference points are therefore: 
Transmitter: at the input to the antenna 
Receiver: at the input to the receiver 
Hence there is no field in Visualyse Professional for the transmit line loss. 
The reference points for the link budgets are therefore as shown in the figure 
below:

Figure 6: Reference Link in Visualyse Professional 
Note that: 
 
GTX = GPeakTX +GRelTX 
 
GRX = GPeakRX +GRelRX 
The receive measurement point can be made to be at the output of the receive 
antenna by setting the LRX to zero. 
4.2 
Noise Calculation 
In Visualyse Professional there are two ways to define the noise at the receiver: 
• 
Enter the noise temperature of the receiver directly 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 21 
 
 
 
• 
Allow Visualyse Professional to calculate the receiver noise 
temperature from the various components. 
The calculation of receiver input noise is based upon the following parameters:

Other Parameters 
There is a wide variety of methods to define link budgets and these can use 
different parameters that might need to be mapped onto Visualyse Professional 
fields. 
• 
Transmitter losses: losses such as transmit link losses can be modelled 
by reducing the transmit power accordingly. 
• 
G/T: Some antennas have their performance defined via their G/T. In this 
case it is necessary to determine separate G and T figures to be entered 
into the link budget above. 
• 
Pointing losses: At the transmit side these can be modelled either by 
reducing the transmit power according to the required level of pointing 
loss or by adding a slight offset to the antenna pointing angles. At the 
receive side the pointing loss could be modelled as either being part of 
the receiver losses or adding a slight offset to the antenna pointing 
angles. 
• 
Polarisation losses: These can be included by either adding them to 
the receive feed loss or adjusting the required C/N or C/(N+I) threshold 
upwards. 
• 
Baseband losses: losses such as implementation losses, demodulation 
margin etc can be modelled by adjustment of the threshold required. 
4.4 
PFD and Field Strength

hence it is simply:

It is sometimes useful to derive the PFD assuming the other propagation models 
within Visualyse Professional’s library. In this case it is possible to calculate the 
signal (wanted or interfering) as received at an isotropic receiver and convert 
into either PFD or field strength.

Interference Adjustments 
4.5.1 
Carrier Overlap 
It should be noted that all unless masks are given, carrier spectre are assumed 
to be square with the following parameters defined: 
• 
Central frequency 
• 
Occupied bandwidth 
• 
Allocated bandwidth 
Typically the wanted and interfering signals have different central frequencies 
and / or bandwidths. It is therefore necessary to consider how to adjust the 
interference calculation to take account of bandwidth factors. The figure below 
shows a typical situation: 
Carrier-A
Carrier-B
OBW-A
OBW-B
Overlap
Frequency-A
Frequency-B
 
Figure 5. Two Overlapping Carriers 
The overlap algorithm is: 
 
StartA = FreqA - OBWA / 2 
 
EndA = FreqA + OBWA / 2 
 
StartB = FreqB - OBWB / 2 
 
EndB = FreqB + OBWB / 2 
Then using the start and end frequencies above: 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 23 
 
 
 
 
StartOverlap = max(StartA, StartB) 
 
EndOverlap = min(EndA, EndB) 
So: 
 
Overlap = EndOverlap - StartOverlap 
This is used in the two bandwidth calculations: whether to include the carrier as 
being partially co-frequency and how much energy from the interfering carrier to 
include. 
4.5.2 
Frequency Overlap 
An interfering carrier is included in the interference calculation if at least one of 
the following is true: 
• 
the overlap between carriers (as calculated above) is greater than zero 
• 
the force co-frequency flag is set 
4.5.3 
Interference Calculation Adjustment 
If there is overlap between two carriers, then it is necessary to determine how 
much energy to include. Three alternatives are available, and the result is the 
BWF factor which is used to multiply the interfering carrier level to get the 
resulting interfering level I.  
No Adjustment 
In this case the BWF is always 1. 
Spectral Power Density 
In this case the ratio of the two is used, based on the power spectral density: 
 
BWF
OBW
OBW
W
I
=
 
Overlap 
In this case the extent of overlap is used, calculated using:

Overlap CarrierW CarrierI
OBWI
=
(
,
)
 
Note that for the force co-frequency case the frequency of both carriers is set to 
the same and OBWW  OBWI, and so this becomes the same as Spectral Power 
Density. 
Multiple Carriers 
In this case it is assumed that there could be multiple interfering carriers in the 
bandwidth of the wanted signal. Each interfering carrier is separated by its ABW, 
but occupies only the OBW. This is shown in the figure below: 
Technical Annex

4.5.4 
Frequency Dependent Adjustment 
The bandwidth adjustment in the tables above is based upon rectangular blocks 
of frequency. Some carriers are shaped, such as TV, and so the interference 
to/from one of these carriers will depend on the separation between central 
frequencies. 
This can be included in the link calculation using a table of advantage vs offset 
of central frequencies. Linear interpolation is used between entries in the table, 
with no extrapolation at the ends of the table. 
4.5.5 
Polarisation Adjustment 
Polarisation adjustment can be done one of three ways: 
• no adjustment 
• standard ITU adjustment table 
• user defined table 
The tables give constant adjustments based on wanted and interfering carrier 
polarisations. The user defined table allows checking for main beam to main 
beam alignment. This occurs when the transmit and receive relative gains are -3 
dB or higher. 
Note that it is possible in Visualyse Professional to do full cross-polar gain 
pattern calculations by entering the cross-polar values for one system (typically 
interfering) and using the co-polar gain pattern for the other system (typically 
wanted). This can be done using the table patterns. 
4.5.6 
Mask Integration to derive NFD 
In Visualyse Professional it is possible to specify the following two masks: 
1. The transmit mask is defined as the relative power density compared to in-
band: in other words as a table it would be defined in dB while in the 
integration the units would be an absolute ratio. 
2. The receive mask is defined as the relative attenuation of the receive signal 
compared to in-band: in other words as a table it would be defined in dB 
while in the integration the units would be an absolute ratio. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 25 
 
 
 
Both the transmit and receive masks are defined using tables with linear 
interpolation in dB between each point and hence can be modelled as a set of 
straight lines with equation (in dBs):

Figure 7: Example mask with interpolation 
Three formats of this integration are available: 
Integrate masks (Classic): Transmit and receive masks integrated and then 
divided by the transmit bandwidth. This is the correct approach if the TX 
spectrum mask is referenced to the mean in-band density i.e. 0 dB is when the 
power density = TX power / occupied bandwidth.

Integrate masks (NFD): Transmit and receive masks integrated and then 
divided by the integration of the transmit mask. This is the correct approach if 
the TX spectrum mask 0 dBi point is referenced to the peak power density. 
Integrate masks (ETSI): Transmit and receive masks are integrated for the 
specified frequency offset and then divided by the integral of the TX and RX 
masks when co-frequency. This is the correct approach to be consistent with the 
methodology in ETSI TR 101 854 and is sometimes called the Frequency 
Dependent Rejection or FDR. To adjust for different bandwidth carriers the 
carrier overlap calculation is included in the adjustment as per section 4.5.3. 
Note on the HCM1 NFD: this is calculated as two terms, called NFD and MD 
where:

the “Standard NFD” calculation described above.

Modelling Radar Reflections 
One of the most important uses of the electromagnetic spectrum is for radar.  
When modelling radar in simulation tools the most important difference from 
most other types of radio system is that the signal is received after two paths via 
a passive reflection, as can be seen in the figure below: 
 
Figure 8: Modelling Radar Reflections 
The signal strength that is received can be calculated using the standard radar 
equation (assuming free space path loss):

Aeff = effective area of the radar receiving antenna  
 
 
PR = received signal 
Radar reflections can be modelled via the Link’s End to Start power option. To 
enable this option: 
• 
Create the radar station with antenna pointing at the aircraft 
• 
Create the aircraft with the required height and for antenna use an 
isotropic gain pattern with gain 0 dBi 
• 
Create a fixed or dynamic link with: 
Aircraft
Radar

Aircraft
Reflections

Technical Annex

o Start station = radar station 
o End station = aircraft 
o Start to End direction: set the transmit power of the antenna 
o End to Start direction: set the transmit power option to be “radar 
reflection” and then set the radar cross section to be that of the 
aircraft and the noise temperature to be that of the radar station, 
as in the example below: 
 
Figure 9: Radar Reflections Link Options 
Having created this link the End to Start’s received power will be the radar 
station’s wanted signal. 
Note that any propagation model could be used, not just free space path loss as 
in the equations above. In particular it could be appropriate to consider: 
• 
Recommendation ITU-R P.452: this includes the effect of terrain and is 
considered acceptable for low altitudes 
• 
Recommendation ITU-R P.528: this is designed for air to ground / 
ground to air links up to a maximum height of 20,000m. It does not 
include the effect of terrain 
Both these propagation models can also include a percentage of time field. 
Note that the following are checked by Visualyse Professional: 
• 
The End→start carrier must be the same as the Start→End carrier 
• 
The End→start frequency must be the same as the Start→End 
frequency 
• 
The end station must use an isotropic antenna with gain = 0 dBi 
• 
The Start→end direction must be enabled

4.8 
Listen before transmit 
Recent developments of cognitive technologies, such as listen before transmit, 
are allowing a range of new sharing scenarios.  
An example of this can be found in the 5 GHz band where Radio Local Area 
Networks (RLANs) can operate as long as they do not cause harmful 
interference into radars in the frequency ranges 5 250 - 5 350 and 5 470 - 5 725 
MHz. The mechanism used to protect the radars is dynamic frequency selection 
based upon listen before transmit technologies.  
As described in Recommendation ITU-R M. 1652, RLANs with the potential to 
transmit up to 200 mW e.i.r.p. must be capable of detecting radar signals of -62 
dBm. If a signal is detected on a channel then it can not be used and instead the 
RLAN must try another channel.  
This is shown graphically in the figure below: 
 
Figure 10: Modelling Listen Before Transmit 
In regulatory terms there could be a constraint similar to:: 
System A can only transmit at power = X if the signal received from 
System B is less than Y 
The question is then, what are the relevant values of X and Y? This requires 
interference analysis taking into account deployment densities and propagation 
conditions. 
This can now be modelled in Visualyse Professional using a bi-directional link 
(i.e. either fixed or dynamic link) as follows: 
o Start→End: model System B’s signal as detected by System A 
(for example, Radar to RLAN) 
o End→Start: model System A transmitting in the signal received 
on the Start→End path is below the detection threshold (i.e. the 
RLAN transmitting) 
The End→Start direction can then be used as one of the interferers into System 
B to determine what the impact would be. 
The link options are in the End→Start direction as shown in the figure below:

5.1.1 
Note on the IMT-MODEL Gain Patterns 
In order to activate the beamforming of these gain patterns, the antenna type, 
station and link options should be: 
• 
Antenna type: ensure “Electronically steerable” is checked 
• 
Station antenna pointing:  
- 
For the BS: set fixed pointing angles 
- 
For the UEs: point at another station (the BS) using random offsets of 
azimuth = {-60, +60}, elevation = {-90, +90} 
• 
Link: either a Fixed or Dynamic link from the BS to the UE (or vice versa) to 
activate the antenna pointing. Note that a transmit or receive link cannot be 
used 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 35 
 
 
 
The BS antenna azimuth could also be defined via the Monte Carlo service area 
Define Variable. 
The parameters used to configure this gain pattern take account of the 
frequency, typically defined in the link. 
5.1.2 
Note on the IMT-MODEL Non-Co-Frequency Gain Pattern 
For antenna types defined by the IMT-MODEL patterns, there are options to 
select how the gain pattern changes for non-co-frequency interference paths.  
The following options are available from the Advanced Beam Options dialog:  
- 
Use co-frequency pattern: the M.2101 pattern is used with D/lambda = 
0.5 for both co-frequency and non-co-frequency scenarios 
- 
Single element pattern: the M.2101 single element pattern is used if the 
victim centre frequency is non-co-frequency 
- 
Assume D/lambda = 0.46: in the M.2101 gain pattern a D/lambda of 0.46 
is used rather than 0.5 
- 
Variable D/lambda: it is assumed that at the centre frequency supplied 
the D/lambda = 0.5, and so for other frequencies the D is derived and 
fixed but the lambda varies depending upon the victim frequency 
The definition of what constitutes “co-frequency” and what “non-co-frequency” 
for the IMT-MODEL gain pattern is set via: 
- 
Centre Frequency: this is the centre frequency that the IMT-MODEL 
antenna has been tuned to 
- 
Co-Frequency Bandwidth: this is the total bandwidth that is defined as 
being co-frequency in range: 
o Minimum = CentreFrequency – CoFrequencyBandwidth./2 
o Maximum = CentreFrequency + CoFrequencyBandwidth./2 
Outside this frequency range the interference path is assumed to be non-co-
frequency. 
To activate these non-co-frequency gain patterns it is necessary to set the 
Interference Path option: 
- 
Calculate Interfering Signal using Victim Frequency = true 
This will use the victim centre frequency when calculating the interfering signal 
and hence allow the antenna type to identify if the path is co-frequency (to the 
IMT-MODEL antenna) or non-co-frequency. It will not affect other calculations, in 
particular the mask integration adjustment or NFD.

Propagation models 
Visualyse Professional contains a number of propagation models that can be 
activated either individually or in combination. These are described in the 
sections below. 
6.1 
ITU-R Recommendations 
6.1.1 
Recommendation ITU-R P.452 
Prediction procedure for the evaluation of microwave interference between 
stations on the surface of the Earth at frequencies above about 0.7 GHz 
This option uses the model in Recommendation ITU-R P.452 for line of sight 
and trans-horizon loss valid for frequencies between 100 MHz and 50 GHz, 
though recent research suggests it might also be applicable at higher 
frequencies.  Visualyse Professional includes all the key components of the 
model, including free space path loss, multi-path enhancements, gaseous 
absorption, diffraction, ducting and layer reflection/refraction, troposcatter and 
clutter loss. 
Data needed for the model can be derived directly from the IDWM database if 
you are using the IDWM module, otherwise they must be input by hand. If a 
terrain database is available it will be used to derive parameters relating to the 
path including diffraction. The clutter model can use the land usage database or 
parameters entered by hand.  
The associated percentage of time can either be user-entered or selected at 
random for Monte Carlo style analysis. The range in the Recommendation is 
0.001 % to 50%, reflecting the fact that this model is designed for interference 
paths and so does not include effects for over 50% of time such as deep fades. 
6.1.2 
Recommendation ITU-R P.525 
Calculation of free-space attenuation 
This is the basic free space path loss that can be used for all paths at all 
frequencies. Note that by default for all paths including terrestrial no 
consideration is made as to whether there is line of sight, and losses increase 
steadily by distance. 
6.1.3 
Recommendation ITU-R P.526 
Propagation by diffraction 
Recommendation ITU-R P.526 defines models to be used in calculating 
diffraction losses for trans-horizon links for frequencies above about 30 MHz. 
Visualyse Professional implements both the smooth Earth model and the 
modified three-knife edge Deygout construction when terrain data is available.  
6.1.4 
Recommendation ITU-R P.528 
Propagation curves for aeronautical mobile and radionavigation services using 
the VHF, UHF and SHF bands 
This Recommendation is designed to predict propagation loss for air to ground / 
ground to air links. It gives curves of loss vs. distance for frequencies 125, 300, 
1200, 5100, 9400 and 15 500 MHz and at TX/RX heights of 15m, 1 km, 10 km, 
and 20 km for probabilities of 5%, 50% and 95% of time. Interpolation is used to 
derive the loss for other frequencies, heights and percentages of time. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 41 
 
 
 
6.1.5 
Recommendation ITU-R P.530 
Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of terrestrial 
line-of-sight systems 
Visualyse Professional contains two of the propagation models in 
Recommendation ITU-R P.530 - rain and multipath fading, as describing below.  
Parameters in various equations within the Recommendation have been derived 
from fading data from links operating in the range 450 MHz – 37 GHz, though 
they should be valid up to frequencies of 50 GHz. 
6.1.5.1 Recommendation ITU-R P.530 Multipath  
This option uses the fade distribution defined in Method 1 of Recommendation 
ITU-R P.530 to generate a fade or multipath enhancement either for a specific 
percentage of time or at random using a Monte-Carlo technique.  
This method is applicable to line-of-sight fixed links and is intended for initial 
planning and link design. The geoclimatic factor K parameter is derived from the 
Recommendation. 
6.1.5.2 Recommendation ITU-R P.530 Rain Fade 
This option uses the model defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.530 to 
generate a rain fade loss. It is intended to be used for line-of-sight fixed links. 
The rain rate can either be entered directly or read automatically from 
Recommendation ITU-R P.837. The associated percentage of time can be either 
entered directly or generated at random for Monte Carlo analysis. 
6.1.6 
Recommendation ITU-R P.618 
Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of Earthspace 
telecommunication systems 
This Recommendation models rain attenuation on earth to space / space to 
earth links and the rain rate can come from ITU-R Recommendation P.837 
versions or directly entered by the user. It is valid for frequencies up to 55 GHz. 
The associated percentage of time can be either entered directly or generated at 
random for Monte Carlo analysis. 
6.1.7 
Recommendation ITU-R P.676 
Attenuation by atmospheric gases 
This method implements losses due to dry air and water vapour defined in 
Annex 2 of Recommendation ITU-R P.676, and is intended to be used for earth 
to space / space to earth links. It is valid for frequencies from 1 GHz to 350 GHz. 
The values of the temperature, water vapour density and pressure can be 
entered directly. 
6.1.8 
Recommendation ITU-R P.840 
Attenuation due to clouds and fog 
This method implements losses due to attenuation from cloud and fogs as 
described in Recommendation ITU-R P.840, and is intended for earth to space / 
space to earth links above about 10 GHz. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 42 
 
 
 
The values of the water concentration in the cloud and associated percentage of 
time can be entered directly. 
6.1.9 
Recommendation ITU-R SF.1395 
Minimum propagation attenuation due to atmospheric gases for use in frequency 
sharing studies between the fixed-satellite service and the fixed service 
This model calculates the attenuation due to atmospheric gases in more detail 
for low elevation paths than the direct method in Recommendation ITU-R P. 
676. It fits a set of curves to a numerical integration at key frequencies. 
6.1.10 Recommendation ITU-R P.1546 
Method for point-to-area predictions for terrestrial services in the frequency 
range 30 MHz to 3 000 MHz 
This propagation model is designed for use in modelling terrestrial services; in 
particular point-to-area predictions in the frequency range 30 MHz to 3 GHz.  
Propagation parameters required by this model such as distance over water and 
whether warm water can be automatically extracted from IDWM or entered by 
hand. 
The clutter model can use the land usage database or parameters entered by 
hand.  
Note that this model calculates loss assuming high height transmitter and low 
height receiver and it is assumed that the loss in the return direction is then the 
same. The loss is calculated to a receiver height of 10m and then adjustments 
must be made for the actual receiver height. 
6.1.11 Recommendation ITU-R P.1791 
Propagation prediction methods for assessment of the impact of ultra-wideband 
devices 
This model is a generic propagation model for short range scenarios built up 
work within the ITU-R studying ultra-wideband (UWB) devices. In the 
Recommendation it is basically a dual slope model with log-normal distribution: 
however we have included a number of extensions that were discussed during 
its development to make it a more generic short range propagation model. 
In its more flexible generic form it comprises four elements: 
1. 
Basic loss: this can either be a single slope or dual slope, with a 
specified break distance and either one or two slopes. For wide band 
signals such as UWB it should use the adjusted basic path loss that 
takes account of the frequency range 
2. 
Optional indoor-outdoor propagation loss: it is assumed that the loss 
varies depending upon the building type and distance to exterior wall, 
with distribution defined by two break points and assuming loss is 
capped below and above and with linear interpolation between break 
points 
3. 
Optional additional log-normal loss with mean zero and standard 
deviation a user entered parameter, which can be different before 
and after the break point 
4. 
Optional additional loss, to cover other propagation effects 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 43 
 
 
 
The log-normal loss can include enhancements, which could in theory result in 
less loss than would be the case with free space path loss. The loss can 
therefore be capped at this value to ensure physically plausible results. 
6.1.12 Recommendation ITU-R P.1812 
A path-specific propagation prediction method for point-to-area terrestrial 
services in the VHF and UHF bands    
This propagation model is designed for use in modelling terrestrial services; in 
particular point-to-area predictions in the frequency range 30 MHz to 3 GHz.  
Conceptually it is a mixture of Recommendations ITU-R P.452 and ITU-R 
P.1546 using: 
• 
The path profile extraction and analysis method in ITU-R P.452 to work 
out propagation loss taking into account details of the terrain 
• 
The clutter loss and percentage of locations within a pixel methodology 
within ITU-R P.1546. 
The propagation model in ITU-R P.452 can calculate propagation loss for 
percentages of time down to 0.001% for frequency over about 700 MHz. 
However it is not feasible at present to predict propagation losses for very small 
percentages of time for the lower frequencies ranges covered by ITU-R P.1812: 
hence it is restricted to percentages between 1 and 50%. 
Visualyse Professional includes all the key components of the model, including 
gaseous absorption, fading, ducting, troposcatter and clutter. Data needed for 
the troposcatter model can be derived directly from the IDWM database if you 
are using the IDWM module, otherwise they must be input by hand. If a terrain 
database is available it will be used to derive parameters relating to the path 
including diffraction. If a land use database is available it will be used to adjust 
the path profile with the heights indicated for each clutter category. 
Propagation parameters required by this model such as distance over water and 
whether warm water can be automatically extracted from IDWM or entered by 
hand. 
6.1.13 Recommendation ITU-R P.2001 
A general purpose wide-range terrestrial propagation model in the frequency 
range 30 MHz to 50 GHz   
This propagation model is designed for terrestrial sharing scenarios, in particular 
for use in Monte Carlo style methodologies. 
Many of the other propagation models handle fading and enhancements 
separately. For example in sharing scenarios involving the fixed service there 
are two models: 
• 
Wanted path: as well as free space path loss, Rec. P.530 is used to 
model fades on the link below the 50% of time level 
• 
Interference path: Rec. P.452 is used to model interference including 
enhancements above the 50% of time level 
When undertaking Monte Carlo modelling it is important to model the full range 
of probabilities for wanted and interfering paths so that the convolution of 
C/(N+I) is correctly calculated. This is was Rec. P.2001 is designed to do. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 44 
 
 
 
This Recommendation has similarities with both P.452 and P.1812 in its 
handling of terrain paths but extends both to cover the full range of percentage 
of times [0.00001% to 99.99999%]. 
At present no clutter model is included in this Recommendation but if need be 
the Extra models terminal clutter loss can be added to the list of propagation 
models with P.2001. 
6.2 
Other Standard Models 
6.2.1 
Crane Rain Model 
This implements the Crane rain model with options to include the NASA data 
set. It is intended to be used for earth to space / space to earth paths. 
Either the climatic region or rain rate and rain height can be entered. 
The associated percentage of time can be either entered directly or generated at 
random for Monte Carlo analysis. 
Note: The implementation is based on Section 4.3 of Electromagnetic Wave 
Propagation Through Rain by Robert K. Crane (© 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 
ISBN 0-471-61376). 
The following modifications were made when implementing the model: 
• 
The section of Crane that deals with horizontal paths over 22.5km is only 
used when a climate region is specified. 
• 
In equation 4.8, 
 the 
 is replaced with 
 
giving 
 
• 
This is similar to the method used in the NASA Propagation Effects 
Handbook for Satellite Systems Design (1989, fourth edition, section 
6.3.2.1, page 6-23). 
• 
Equation 4.10 is used instead of the approximations which follow it. 
• 
Equation 4.13 is used instead of 4.12 
• 
Alpha and K in section 4.3.1 are calculated using Rec. ITU-R P.838 
(1992) 
6.2.2 
Appendix S.7 (WRC-95)  
Visualyse Professional includes the propagation model defined in Appendix S.7 
as agreed at WRC 95 (previously known as Appendix 28). This can be either 
Mode 1, Mode 2 or a combined model. It is valid between 1 and 40 GHz. 
If the IDWM model is available then it will extract the zone(s) required for Mode 
1 calculations automatically, otherwise a single zone can be directly selected. 
The associated percentage of time can be either entered directly or generated at 
random for Monte Carlo analysis. 
If the IDWM model is available then it will extract the rain rate, rain cell size, and 
vapour density required for Mode 2 calculations automatically, otherwise these 
fields can be entered directly. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 45 
 
 
 
6.2.3 
TIA Bulletin 10F 
The US Telecommunications Industry Association has produced a technical 
bulletin relating to interference calculations for fixed service systems. One 
element is a model for short term deep fading. Visualyse Professional allows this 
model to be used across all percentages of time by linearly extrapolating from 
deep to shallow fading.  
6.2.4 
Longley-Rice 
The Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Model 
This propagation model is the point to point version of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Institute for 
Telecommunication Sciences’s Irregular Terrain Model (ITM) version 1.2.2. 
As well as using the path profile extracted from the terrain database there are 
also options to select the surface refractivity, dielectric ground constant, ground 
conductivity and radio climate from standard options. 
The median propagation loss can be adjusted in two dimensions: 
• 
Time: you can enter the percentage of time that the propagation loss A 
will not be exceeded i.e. A(qT) 
• 
Confidence: Confidence that the propagation loss will A(qT) not exceed 
the level for the specified qT of time 
6.3 
Terrestrial Mobile 
Visualyse Professional contains three standard propagation models to calculate 
median loss for terrestrial mobile applications. 
6.3.1 
Egli 
The Egli model is an empirical model applicable to a mobile environment. It is a 
1/r4 model with corrections for antenna heights and frequency.  
The calculations for this model have been derived from algorithms in: “The 
Mobile Radio Propagation Channel”, J. D. Parsons, Pentech Press 1992.  This 
simplified Egli model is valid for use at frequencies between 90 MHz and 1 GHz 
and has no input parameters. 
6.3.2 
Hata / COST-231 
The Hata model is an empirical model applicable to a mobile environment, which 
gives the median loss and is widely used and was extended by COST-231. The 
original Hata model was valid for frequencies from 150 MHz – 1,500 MHz and 
the COST-231 version was extended to 2 GHz. 
The implementation of COST-231 is consistent with the approach in defined in 
ECC Report 68.  
It should be noted that the Hata version of this model is asymmetric – the loss is 
assumed to be calculated in the direction from the (higher) base station to the 
(lower height) mobile station. To allow calculation in the reverse direction, the 
COST-231 implementation assumes the station with the highest antenna is the 
base station independent of other parameters of the network. 
In both cases the environment can be selected as one of urban, suburban or 
rural.  
Technical Annex 
 
Page 46 
 
 
 
6.3.3 
Lee 
The Lee model is an empirical model applicable to a mobile environment, and 
allows the median transmission loss, the slope of path loss curve, and frequency 
adjustment factors to be entered. 
The calculations for this model have been derived from algorithms in: “The 
Mobile Radio Propagation Channel”, J. D. Parsons, Pentech Press 1992. 
6.3.4 
IMT Path Loss Models 
These models are designed for short range paths for the wanted or interfering 
signals of IMT-2020 / 5G systems. The models included are: 
• 
ABG 
• 
CI/CIF 
• 
3GPP TR 38.900 
• 
3GPP TR 38.901 
• 
WINNER II 
• 
WINNER+ 
• 
ITU-R Report M.2135 
The alpha, beta, gamma (ABG) and close-in / close-in with frequency-dependent 
path loss exponent (CI/CIF) path loss models were defined in document ITU-R 
WP 5D/TEMP/292. Each requires a set of parameters which will depend upon 
the environment models, such as the examples in the document referenced. 
The 3GPP wanted signal path loss models are defined in these documents: 
• 
3GPP Technical Report (TR) 38.900: Study on channel model for 
frequency spectrum above 6 GHz 
• 
3GPP TR 38.901: Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 
100 GHz 
These define path loss models for specific environments, taking into account 
whether the path is line of sight (LOS) or non-LOS. For some environments the 
path could also be from indoor to outdoor. 
The 3GPP TR 38.900 and 38.901 path loss models are not symmetric, in that 
they have as inputs the BS and UE heights. To ensure that Visualyse 
Professional identifies the stations correctly, it should be configured so that: 
• 
The BS is a Terrestrial Fixed Station 
• 
The UE is a Mobile Station 
Note that 3GPP TR 38.900 and 38.901 have, for some environments, 
assumptions about the BS height. For example in the UMa environment it is 
assumed that the height of the BS is 25m while for UMi – Street Canyons this is 
10m. This value would be used within these path loss models irrespective of the 
height set in the station dialog. The equations to determine the probability of 
LOS makes similar assumptions about antenna heights. 
In addition, some parameters have ranges of acceptable values which are 
enforced. For example, the RMa environment requires the average street width 
and building height to be entered which are constrained to be between 5m and 
50m. 
Technical Annex

The WINNER propagation models are described in the following documents: 
• 
WINNER II Channel Models (Project IST-4-027756, versions D1.1.2 
V1.2) 
• 
WINNER+ Final Channel Models (Project CELTIC / CP5-026, version 
1.0) 
6.3.5 
Recommendation ITU-R P.2109: Building Entry Loss 
Recommendation ITU-R P.2109 (previously described as P.BEL) defines the 
entry / exit loss for a path between a station inside and another station outside a 
building, as in the figure below: 
 
The loss will depend upon a number of factors, such as frequency, elevation 
angle of path at the station inside and the type of building. Measurements noted 
that a key factor was whether the exterior is made from: 
• 
Traditional materials 
• 
Thermally efficient materials 
There can be a wide variation in losses depending upon details of the materials, 
the location of the station inside, the floors, furniture etc. Therefore, rather than 
giving a single value a statistical model was used that defines the building entry 
loss exceeded for a given likelihood. 
The inputs are therefore: 
• 
Frequency 
• 
Elevation angle 
• 
Building material 
• 
Probability 
The probability can either be entered or selected at random for Monte Carlo 
analysis. The elevation angle can either be entered or will be calculated from the 
radio path. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 48 
 
 
 
6.3.6 
Recommendation ITU-R P.2108 
Recommendation ITU-R P.2108 (previously described as P.Clutter) contains 
three component models depending upon whether: 
• 
Terminal below representative clutter height 
• 
Terrestrial terminal within the clutter 
• 
One terminal is within the clutter and the other is a satellite, aeroplane or 
other platform above the surface of the Earth. 
6.3.6.1 Height / Gain Clutter Model 
This is the same model as in P.1812 and depends upon: 
• 
Frequency 
• 
Antenna height 
• 
Street width 
• 
Representative clutter height 
• 
Clutter type 
As this model is “stand-alone” it should be combined with other propagation 
models as considered appropriate, such as that within Recommendation ITU-R 
P.2001 (which does not include a clutter loss model). Note that if used with 
P.452 the clutter model within that Recommendation should be switched off. 
The model is valid for the frequency range 30 MHz to 3 GHz. 
6.3.6.2 Statistical Clutter Model 
This model is purely statistical in nature, depending upon: 
• 
Frequency 
• 
Distance 
• 
Percentage of locations 
The model is valid for the frequency range 2 to 67 GHz and for a minimum path 
length of: 
• 
0.25 km (for the correction to be applied at only one end of the path) 
• 
1 km (for the correction to be applied at both ends of the path) 
6.3.6.3 Elevation Clutter Model 
This model gives a clutter loss that is elevation dependent. It is not a fixed value 
but probabilistic, so a percentage of locations (samples) value must also be 
given. The parameters are: 
• 
Frequency 
• 
Elevation angle 
• 
Percentage of locations 
This model is valid for the frequency range: 10 to 100 GHz and elevation angles 
from 0° to 90°. 
Technical Annex

6.4 
Fixed loss Models 
6.4.1 
Const Fixed 
This option adds a constant dB value to the loss. The constant is a user input. 
6.4.2 
Const Per Km 
This option adds a fixed loss per kilometre of atmosphere through which the 
path passes.  
6.4.3 
Transhorizon loss 
This allows a fixed loss to be included should the path extend beyond the radio 
horizon. The loss and effective earth radius can be entered by the user. 
This can be combined with ITU-R P.525 propagation model which by default 
does not include a loss for terrestrial trans-horizon paths. Note this is not 
needed for earth-space links that are assumed to fail when there is no longer 
line of sight. 
6.4.4 
Clutter loss 
The clutter loss can be entered by hand or taken from the land use database. 
6.5 
Extra Clutter Model  
This option (found in Extra Models) defines the following options: 
6.5.1 
No Clutter Loss 
Lctt = 0. 
6.5.2 
Constant Clutter Loss 
Fixed user entered clutter loss, Lctt,u. 
6.5.3 
P.2108 Clutter Model with zero loss short paths 
If distance (d) < 0.25 km:  
Lctt = 0  
Otherwise: 
 Lctt = P.2108 Loss. 
6.5.4 
P.2108 Clutter Model with linear in d interpolation 
If distance (d) < 0.04 km:  
Lctt = 0 
If d >= 0.025 km: 
 Lctt = P.2108. 
If 0.04 < d < 0.25 km: 
calculate clutter loss at distance d = 0.25 (Lctt (0.25))  
Lctt = Lctt (0.25) * (d - 0.04) / 0.21. 
6.5.5 
P.2108 Clutter Model with log-linear in d interpolation 
Lctt = max{0, P.2108 Loss} 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 50 
 
 
 
6.5.6 
Constant Loss, Likelihood by Distance 
User entered parameters: 
• 
Fixed user entered clutter loss Lctt,u 
• 
Minimum distance, d0 
• 
Exponent factor, k 
 
Calculate likelihood of line of sight, pLoS: 
 
if distance (d) < d0: 
pLoS =1                  
 
 
iIf d > d0: 
 pLoS  = e^k(d0 - d)        
  
Then calculate clutter loss using random number p: 
 
 
if p <= pLoS: 
Lctt = 0 
 
 
if p > pLoS: 
Lctt = Lctt,u 
 
6.6 
Other Models 
6.6.1 
Dry Air 
This option calculates attenuation due to dry air using frequency dependent 
curves defined in ITU-R Report 719 to calculate the loss on the path. 
6.6.2 
Water  
This option switches on just the water vapour attenuation part of 
Recommendation ITU-R P.676. 
6.7 
Use with Define Variable Module 
The Define Variable Module allows any input parameter to be specified for each 
time step as being selected from a distribution or defined from set of values. 
This can be used to extend the propagation models further – for example to 
specific distributions such as Rayleigh or log-normal fading or user entered 
distributions.

Visualyse Professional  
There are two possible file formats whereby the data is read in in rows or 
columns.  
The fields are text, separated by one of the following: 
• tabs 
• commas 
• spaces 
7.2.2.1 Format 1: 
The file format is described below. The square brackets would not appear in the 
actual file.

[Gain X-1Y-m] 
: 
[Gain X-nY-m] 
 
where: 
[AzStart] 
= start (smallest) azimuth in degrees 
[AzStep] 
= spacing between azimuth grid points (degrees) 
[AzNum] 
= number of azimuth points 
[ElStart] 
= start (smallest) elevation in degrees 
[ElStep] 
=  spacing between elevation grid points (degrees) 
[ElNum]

7.3 
ITU Graphical Data 
Visualyse Professional has the ability to read/write files based on the format for 
shaped beams specified in ITU CR/58. The file format structure is text with 
sections as used by Microsoft Windows INI files, i.e.: 
[SectionName1] 
key1=value1 
key2=value2 
 
[SectionName2] 
key1=value1 
key2=value2 
 
The sections are: 
• FormatInfo: specifies the file format 
• GeoMain: contains general information such as name and satellite location 
• Header: specifies parameters such as number of contours and boresights 
• Bi: one section for each boresight 
• Ci: one section for each contour, specifying level and series of lat/long points 
These sections are described in more detail in the sections below. 
7.3.1 
FormatInfo 
This has a single field to specify the version which is set to one, i.e.: 
Key 
Type Description 
format_v
er 
int 
Version, set to 1 
 
7.3.2 
GeoMain 
This section contains global information about the file. The fields are: 
Key 
Type Description 
adm 
char 
The notifying administration: this 
field is not used within Visualyse 
Professional and so is set to DK for 
export. 
ntwk_org 
char 
The responsible organisation 
operating the satellite: this field is 
not used within Visualyse 
Professional and so is set to DK for 
export. 
sat_nam
e 
char 
This is the satellite name and is 
used as the antenna description 
long_no
m 
char 
The satellite’s nominal longitude, 
used as the antenna longitude 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 54 
 
 
 
n_diag 
int 
The number of diagrams: not used 
by Visualyse Professional, so set to 
1 for export. 
 
7.3.3 
COHeader 
This section describes the contours contained within the file. The fields are: 
Key 
Type Description 
beam_id 
char 
The designation of the beam. Set to 
1 for export 
emi_rcp 
char 
The emission / reception flag at the 
satellite, set to E for emission, R for 
reception. Visualyse Professional 
does not distinguish between up 
and down beams: for export this 
field is set to E. 
polar_dis
c 
char 
The polarisation discriminator, set 
to C for co-polarisation, X for cross-
polarisation. Visualyse Professional 
contours are co-polar (though could 
be used as cross polar) and so this 
field should be set to C. 
reason 
char 
The reason for notification: not used 
by Visualyse so set to A (advance 
publication) 
n_bore 
int 
Number of boresights 
n_cont 
int 
Number of contours 
 
Visualyse Professional adds a field to this section to specify the peak gain of the 
beam. This would not affect how the file is read by other systems, but is required 
to completely define the pattern. This field has the following structure: 
Key 
Type Description 
gain 
real 
peak gain in dBi of the beam 
 
7.3.4 
Bi 
There is a separate section for each of the boresights. Each section has the 
section name of the form Bi, for example the first boresight would have section 
name B1. 
Each boresight section has the following keys: 
 
 
Technical Annex

Terrain Data General Import File Format 
The General file format is a flexible documented format to the standard set of 
terrain file formats (USGS GTOPO 30, SRTM etc). Users can translate terrain of 
their own format into the General file format for loading into Visualyse 
Professional.  
The first terrain data point read is the height at the bottom left of the terrain 
region specified.  The file is binary and each spot height is 2 bytes.   
By default values of -9999 will be displayed as sea on the map so as to 
differentiate from land with height zero.  The Propagation models and Path 
Profile will use a height of zero in place of  -9999.   
The first height data point is taken to be the terrain height at the bottom left the 
next.  All the fields are twos compliment, little-endian (Intel) integers and the file 
is packed binary.

There is a grid of clutter codes starting from bottom left. Each clutter code 
represents the environment across the whole of the pixel: therefore with a grid of 
n lat/long lines there are n pixel codes not n+1 (as for terrain). 
The location of the bottom right of the rectangle is defined via the 
(LatitudeBottom, LongitudeRight) point. The other corner of the rectangle is 
calculated from: 
LongitudeRight = LongitudeLeft + LongitudePoints * LongitudeSpacing 
LatitudeTop = LatitudeBottom + LatitudePoints * LatitudeSpacing 
Each clutter code is assumed to be an integer in the range [0..15] so that there 
are sixteen possible clutter environments.  
Mapping of codes to propagation parameters 
The clutter codes are mapped to propagation parameters such as height of 
clutter and distance to clutter in the Visualyse Professional configuration dialog 
as shown in the figure below: 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 60 
 
 
 
 
Reference Geoid 
The clutter file format does not specify the reference geoid and all data used in a 
simulation (clutter data, terrain data and station locations) should use the same 
reference geoid.

Generic clutter data can be imported into Visualyse Professional using the 
following file format.

View Overlay XML Files 
It is possible to overlay images such as maps and vector data such as 
boundaries, roads etc on top of the Mercator, Plate Carree and 3D views. This 
section gives the file format for the XML file that describes the data. 
The XML file and any referenced graphics files must be located in the “Visualyse 
7/Overlays” directory at the time that Visualyse Professional 7 is started. 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 62 
 
 
 
7.7.1 
View Overlay Images 
Images in formats such as JPG and BMP can be displayed on top of Visualyse 
Professional’s views. An XML file is used to define the four corners (lat, long) in 
either degrees or radians, and also point to the relevant file. 
The format is given below, with the fields to complete contained within square 
brackets and in capital letters - i.e. [MAP_NAME] 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
<image xmlns="http://www.transfinite.com" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    <bottomRight units="[UNITS]" latitude="[LAT_BR]" longitude="[LONG_BR]" /> 
    <colour>[TTRRGGBB]</colour> 
</image> 
 
The fields to enter are therefore: 
NAME

FILENAME 
filename may include full path or be relative to overlays 
directory 
UNITS 
either “degrees” or “radians” 
LAT_BL 
latitude in relevant units of bottom left of image 
LAT_TL 
latitude in relevant units of top left of image 
LAT_BR 
latitude in relevant units of bottom right of image 
LAT_TR 
latitude in relevant units of top right of image 
LONG_BL 
longitude in relevant units of bottom left of image 
LONG_TL 
longitude in relevant units of top left of image 
LONG_BR 
longitude in relevant units of bottom right of image 
LONG_TR 
longitude in relevant units of top right of image 
TTRRGGBB codes in hex for the Transparency, Red, Green & Blue to 
use 
Note that it is necessary to define the lat/long of all four corners of the image 
rather than just top (top left and bottom right) as some images could be rotated. 
For example, maps generated in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or local 
variants such as the UK’s National Grid do not always align with vertically with 
the North-South line. 
An example of this format is given below:

View Overlay Vector Line Data 
Vector data such as roads, railways, borders, boundaries etc can be displayed 
on top of Visualyse Professional’s views. An XML file is used to define a set of 
(lat, long) points and a line colour is used to connect them. 
The format is given below, with the fields to complete contained within square 
brackets and in capital letters - i.e. [NAME] 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

Text File Format 
7.8.1 
Structure 
Visualyse Professional has a file format that allows complete definition of 
simulations in a standard ASCII text file. In it are definitions of all objects and 
their attributes required to specify any Visualyse Professional sharing scenario. 
The file format can also be used to define single elements – for example a 
station or an antenna. 
The format is based upon the Microsoft Windows INI structure, using section 
headers and field names as follows: 
[Section Header] 
[Field Name] = (value) 
The section header describes the object being defined based upon the 
Visualyse Professional object tree. Each simulation starts at the root object 
“Simul” and then has branches for stations, antennas, links etc separated by a 
period or “.”2. 
So the section header for the geographic location of a station called “FS TX” 
would be: 
[Simul.Station List.FS TX.Start LatLongHeight] 
Field names are the variables associated with the object defined by the section 
header – so for the geographic location the variables would be latitude and 
longitude. The section would then start as follows: 
[Simul.Station List.FS TX.Start LatLongHeight] 
Name=Start LatLongHeight 
Description=Start Earth latitude, longitude, height 
Latitude=N38:58'31.2034" 
Longitude=W77:9'39.1658" 
 
2 This is the reason that Visualyse Professional object names are not allowed to include the “.” character 
Technical Annex 
 
Page 68 
 
 
 
7.8.2 
Creating Text Files 
While in theory it is possible to create text files solely using a text editor, in 
practice it is easier to get Visualyse Professional to make a template which you 
can then edit. This ensures the format is the one that Visualyse Professional 
expects, as all the variables and objects must be specified in the correct format. 
These can be done by either: 
• 
Creating a simulation file (as normal) and then using the “Save As” 
option and selecting the text file format; 
• 
Opening the Model View and saving the object required as a text file. 
7.8.3 
Batch Mode 
It is also possible to run Visualyse Professional in batch mode from the 
command line. This could be useful if there are many simulations to be run or an 
iterative approach is required. 
With this file format the command line would be something like: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Visualyse 7\Program>visualyse –x mss-
fs.txt  
where the -x command closes Visualyse Professional on completion of the run.  
This command line would save the results into the file “mss-fs.txt” which could 
then be read in by other programs. 
7.9 
Service Area Wizard 
Station locations can be read into Visualyse Professional using the service area 
wizard. This requires a text file with a set of rows similar to this: 
[Lat-1], [Long-1] 
[Lat-2], [Long-2] 
 
: 
: 
 
The fields should be separated by commas. 
7.10 TLEs 
Satellites orbit data can be read into Visualyse Professional using the Two Line 
Element (TLE) format. 
This file format is defined in the document that can be found here: 
 
 
http://celestrak.com/columns/v04n03/ 
7.11 FS Import 
The FS Import tool uses a pre-defined format in which each row defines one 
point to point (PtP) link. The FS Import requires the following fields to be defined 
and then either pasted into Visualyse Professional or be available in a CSV 
format file:
