Introduction 
This document describes the example files supplied with the Version 7 of 
Visualyse Professional. They have been selected to give an idea how Visualyse 
Professional can model a range of radio systems and sharing scenarios. 
Visualyse Professional Version 7 is a very flexible tool to study interference 
between radio systems, in particular radio communication systems. We have 
grouped the example files into the following categories: 
• 
Aeronautical 
• 
Digital Dividend 
• 
Earth station coordination 
• 
Fixed planning and coordination 
• 
GSO to GSO Satellite 
• 
Maritime 
• 
Military 
• 
Network Coverage 
• 
Non-GSO Satellites 
• 
Others 
• 
PCS/AWS 
• 
Radiolocation 
• 
Satellite & Terrestrial 
• 
Short range devices 
• 
Space Science Service 
Some files require one or more of the Modules that enhance the main product: 
• 
Terrain  
• 
Traffic 
• 
Define Variable 
• 
IDWM 
At the start of each section there is a table which shows the modules needed for 
that example file. In the case of the Terrain Module it is also necessary to have the 
right terrain data file available, so these are also listed. The terrain files should be 
in the Visualyse 7/Terrain directory. 
If you have a full version of Visualyse Professional you can also look at these files: 
however, should the example file use a Module for which you do not have a 
license, the demonstration might work incorrectly. In this case remove your dongle 
so that you operate in Demonstration Mode.  
Hint: You can change the parameters to see how that would impact the results, but only 
at the start. You might have to reset the simulation to start: “Rewind” button on the 
control bar. 
Note: These simulation files have in places been simplified for clarity.

3.1.1 Aeronautical satellite service 
Action: 
Run simulation 
Modules used: 
None 
Terrain regions: 
None 
Frequency band: 
L 
Station types: 
GSO Satellite, Aeronautical 
Propagation models: 
Free space, ITU-R Rec.P.676 
 
This example shows Visualyse Professional modelling communication between 
aircraft and GSO satellites. 
The simulation uses a dynamic modelling whereby the planes are “flown” across 
the world from Europe/US to Asia. During the route, they access broadband 
services via a network of GSO satellites, one for each ocean region. 
To provide the high gain needed to close the link, the GSO satellite uses an 
antenna that generates 89 thin spot beams covering the field of view. As the 
aircraft moves it must hand-over between these beams. 
Visualyse Professional is calculating the C/N of the uplink as the aircraft moves 
and switches between beam assuming free space path loss and gaseous 
absorption in ITU-R Rec.P.676. 
The figure above shows the simulation with three views open: 
• 
Plate Carrée map view (top) showing the aircraft, the satellites, the satellite 
spot beams, the links, and the tracks of the aircraft 
• 
Quick graph (bottom left) showing the how the C/N for each link varies with 
time. As the aircraft moves this plot will follow the peaks and troughs of the 
currently active beam

3.1.2 Aircraft into FS stations 
Action: 
Run simulation 
Modules used: 
None 
Terrain regions: 
None 
Frequency band: 
Ku 
Station types: 
Aeronautical, Fixed 
Propagation models: 
Free space, ITU-R Rec.P.530, Diffraction at visible 
horizon 
 
This example shows Visualyse Professional modelling interference from airborne 
radar into a fixed link at Ku band. 
The aircraft is flying across the UK transmitting at high power on a frequency also 
used by a point to point fixed link. The antenna on the aircraft is rotating round 
pointing 10 degrees below the horizon and is modelled using ITU-R Rec.F.699 
gain pattern. Note the radar antenna spin rate has been reduced to make the 
example easier to see. 
The propagation model for the air to ground is assumed to be free space path loss 
if line of sight otherwise an additional diffraction term is used.  
The fixed link is modelled using free space path loss plus the ITU-R Rec.P.530 
rain and fade models which means the wanted signal can vary in time. The fixed 
link antennas are based upon an ETSI specification style table. 
As the aircraft flies and its antenna rotates and the fade varies on the fixed link the 
C/I changes. When the C/I is below the threshold of C/I = 25 dB the link is 
assumed to be suffering interference and is shown in red. 
The simulation shows the following views open:

service stations, the aircraft antenna footprint, and the link coloured as

AWACs to the fixed link

3.1.3 Aircraft with pre-set track across US and interference from FS 
Action: 
Run simulation 
Modules used: 
Define Variable 
Terrain regions: 
None 
Frequency band: 
S 
Station types: 
Aeronautical, Fixed 
Propagation models: 
Free space, ITU-R Rec.P.676, Diffraction when 
beyond line of sight, Aircraft body shielding 
 
This example shows a scenario whereby a commercial aircraft flies across the US 
using part of C band (2 GHz) for communication services. This band is also used 
by a number of point to point fixed links, and therefore there is the potential for 
interference. 
The aircraft is assumed to travel along pre-defined traffic routes: three are 
modelled: 
• 
Los Angeles to New York 
• 
New York to Seattle 
• 
Seattle to Los Angeles 
One hundred fixed service transmitters were deployed across the US, with random 
antenna azimuth and elevations. Each was assumed to have a single antenna 
using ITU-R Rec.P.699 as its gain pattern assuming a 2m dish. 
The propagation model from the FS to the aircraft included the following four 
terms: 
1. Free space path loss 
2. Diffraction when aircraft is beyond visible line of sight of the fixed station 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 15 
 
 
 
3. Attenuation due to atmospheric gases in ITU-R Rec.P.676 
4. Shielding loss due to body of aircraft 
5. The aggregate I/N at the receiver on the aircraft is then calculated from all 
one hundred of the FS transmitters. 
The simulation is shown with four windows open: 
1. Mercator view (top left) showing the aircraft, its field of view and each of the 
fixed service transmitters 
2. Statistics view (bottom left) showing the cumulative distribution function of 
I/N  
3. Quick plot (top right) showing how the I/N would vary against time 
4. Watch window (bottom right) showing the worst single interfering link 
budget and the aggregate interference

3.1.4 AMT vs. Globalstar 
Action: 
Run simulation 
Modules used: 
Define Variable 
Terrain regions: 
None 
Frequency band: 
C 
Station types: 
Non-GSO Satellite, Earth Station, Aeronautical 
Propagation models: 
Free space 
 
This scenario relates to sharing between aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) and 
non-GSO MSS feeder links at around 5 GHz. In the study cycle leading up to WRC 
07 it was Agenda Items 1.5 and 1.6. 
The simulation is configured with the victim being the uplink to the Globalstar (G*) 
network from a gateway in Australia. Co-frequency are a number of aircraft being 
tested in the desert using the same frequency. 
The Define Variable module is being used to specify the location of the aircraft 
either: 
• 
On a square flight path 
• 
Selected at random using Monte Carlo methods 
On each aircraft there are two antennas – one pointing up and one pointing down. 
The interference is then the aggregate at the satellite receiver of all antennas on all 
aircraft. 
The propagation model for the wanted link from the gateway to the satellites and 
the interfering link from the aircraft to the satellites is assumed to be simply free 
space path loss. 
In the simulation file, there are three windows open:

station, the link connecting the gateway to the highest elevation satellites, 
the aircraft and their field of views. 
• 
Watch window (top left) showing the wanted and interfering link budgets 
• 
Statistics window (bottom left) showing the cumulative distribution function 
of the I/N at the satellite. In this case the highest I/N is predicted to be 
around -7.5 dB

This simulation shows how aircraft traffic routes can be modelled in Visualyse 
Professional. The simulation shows a number of routes in the vicinity of the UK, 
some of which are short-haul and some of which are long haul.

3.2 Digital Dividend 
This section contains the following examples: 
• 
3G into DVB Punched Holes 
• 
DVB into 3G Punched Holes 
• 
Monte Carlo Mobile into DTT Fixed Receive 
This section considers issues relating to the so-called “Digital Dividend”, the 
release of spectrum in parts of UHF as analogue TV is switched off. This could be 
used for a variety of purposes, including mobile applications such as IMT-2000, 
WiMAX, and DVB-H. However, these cellular like services could cause or suffer 
interference with broadcasting applications, and so there has been a request for 
studies by the ITU under WRC-11 Agenda Item 1.17. 
The examples are based around sharing scenarios between digital TV and mobile 
applications – and in particular between fixed TV receivers and IMT-2000 services. 
Others scenarios could be considered and we would be happy to discuss this 
further. There are also sharing scenarios involving other services – such as 
aeronautical radionavigation – for which there could be examples in other sections 
of this document.

3.2.1 3G into DVB Punched Holes 
Action: 
None 
Modules used: 
Terrain, IDWM 
Terrain regions: 
South Wales 
Frequency band: 
UHF 
Station types: 
Broadcasting, Mobile 
Propagation models: 
ITU-R Rec.P.1546, ITU-R Rec.P.452 
 
This example considers the impact of a mobile network working in an adjacent 
band to a broadcaster. It considers a 1 kW local in-fill transmitter in the South 
Wales part of Britain transmitting DVB-T on channel C63, i.e. a frequency of 810 
MHz. In the adjacent channel C64, i.e. a frequency of 818 MHz is the downlink or 
base station transmit part of a 3G / IMT-2000 network.  
The analysis identifies the locations where interference from the adjacent mobile 
operator would cause interference into a fixed TV receiver. The analysis takes 
account of all the key factors including: 
• 
Terrain and land-use data: we have loaded the relevant terrain data and 
(where available for copyright reasons) the land-use data to derive clutter 
loss 
• 
Propagation models: we have used ITU-R Rec.P.1546 for the calculation of 
the broadcaster’s wanted signal, using a location variability of 95%. For the 
interference path we have used ITU-R Rec.P.452 due to its detailed 
modelling when terrain data is available. We have a library of other ITU-R 
models including P.1812 and generic models such as Hata and dual slope. 
• 
Gain patterns: we have modelled the fixed receive antenna using the 
pattern in the RRC-06 Final Acts and the base stations as having three 
sector antennas with downtilt of 2°. Visualyse Professional includes a wide 
range of gain patterns and can include measured data in table format 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 21 
 
 
 
• 
Interference measures: we have undertaken this analysis using the C/N or 
C/(N+I) measure, but we can also calculate I, I/N, C/I, and PFD / field 
strength. 
• 
Carrier shapes and net filter discrimination (NFD): Visualyse Professional 
undertakes a direct analytic integration of the TX spectrum mask and RX 
filter characteristics to calculate the NFD for this path.  
The result is a highly accurate prediction of the impact of a 3G network operating 
in an adjacent band on the coverage of a broadcasting network. In the screen shot 
above you can see four windows: 
• 
Mercator map view (top right) showing the coverage of the broadcasting 
system in the absence of interference overlaid on a map and also showing 
the clutter database categories (where available) 
• 
Mercator map view (top left) showing the reduction in coverage of the 
broadcasting system due to the “punched-holes” from the 3G network’s 
base station transmissions 
• 
Frequency view (bottom left) showing the broadcasting receive mask 
assumed and the spectrum mask of the 3G transmitter, and the NFD 
calculated, around 46 dB 
• 
Path profile view (bottom right) showing the terrain between the broadcast 
transmitter and the test point fixed receiver.

3.2.2 DVB into 3G Punched Holes 
Action: 
None 
Modules used: 
Terrain, IDWM 
Terrain regions: 
South Wales 
Frequency band: 
UHF 
Station types: 
Broadcasting, Mobile 
Propagation models: 
ITU-R Rec.P.452 
 
This scenario considers the reverse case to the previous example, and analyses 
where the mobile network’s coverage would be reduced due to adjacent band 
interference from the broadcaster. 
In the screen shot above you can see four windows: 
• 
Mercator map view (top right) showing where the wanted signal of the 
mobile system is sufficient to provide a service, overlaid on a map and also 
showing the clutter database categories (where available) 
• 
Mercator map view (top left) displays the C/I of interference from the 
broadcast transmitter into the mobile network, showing the “punched-hole” 
effect from the broadcast transmitter 
• 
Frequency view (bottom left) showing the 3G receive mask assumed and 
the spectrum mask of the broadcast transmitter, and the NFD calculated, 
around 46 dB 
• 
Path profile view (bottom right) showing the terrain between one of the 
base stations and the test point UE. 
It can be seen that the higher power broadcast transmitter causes significant 
“punched-holes” into the mobile networks coverage. To maintain coverage the 
mobile operator would have to plan with increased number of base stations near 
Demonstration Files

each of the broadcaster’s transmitters. This in turn would increase interference into 
the broadcast network!

3.2.3 Monte Carlo Mobile into DTT Fixed Receive 
Action: 
Run Simulation 
Modules used: 
Define Variable 
Terrain regions: 
None 
Frequency band: 
UHF 
Station types: 
Broadcasting, Mobile 
Propagation models: 
Rec.P.1546, Hata / COST 231 
 
The previous two examples where based upon the premise of prediction of interference 
between real networks – i.e. using actual locations and powers to work out the resulting 
coverage that can be expected. 
To undertake regulatory analysis it is often useful to consider generic scenarios 
with generic propagation models to identify lessons that are widely applicable. 
This example considers one such simulation, using Monte Carlo methods to 
identify the impact of a mobile network on a fixed receiver using generic 
propagation models. 
A test area has been configured with a grid of 20 base stations of a mobile network 
deployed in a hexagonal grid. Each cell is assumed to contain 10 mobile users 
simultaneously active and transmitting / receiving. The question this file addresses 
is if this network operating in the adjacent channel to a DTT broadcast to a fixed 
receiver, what would be the likelihood of interference? 
Two sub-questions are actually being addressed in this simulation file: 
1. What would be interference into the fixed receiver if the adjacent band was 
used for a mobile network’s downlink? 
2. What would be interference into the fixed receiver if the adjacent band was 
used for a mobile network’s uplink? 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 25 
 
 
 
To address this question a fixed receiver has been deployed, and its location 
randomised within the central mobile network cell. Simultaneously the location of 
each of the 200 mobiles has been randomised within its cell. Power control is used 
on both the uplink and downlink and the propagation models used are: 
Hata / COST 231: base station to mobile / DTT receiver, mobile to base station / 
DTT receiver 
ITU-R Rec.P.1546: broadcast transmitter to DTT receiver, assuming 95% location 
coverage and 50% of time 
This form of Monte Carlo analysis produces results in the form of statistics, and in 
this case there are cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of C/N, C/I, and 
C/(N+I) for the two cases above. 
The screen shot above shows three windows open: 
• 
Mercator view (right) showing the location of the base stations, the mobile, 
and the DTT receiver, and the links. A grid is overlaid with 1 km spacing. 
• 
Statistics view (top left) showing the CDFs of C/N, C/I and C/(N+I) for each 
of the two cases above 
• 
Frequency view (bottom left) showing the DVB and WCDMA carriers in 
adjacent channels 
It can be seen that interference from the IMT-2000 downlink (BS TX) direction 
causes greater interference than the uplink (MS TX) direction, but both would 
reduce the likelihood of good reception.

This example shows Visualyse Professional calculating the coordination contour 
around a satellite Earth Station. 
The Earth Station is in Tunisia and is communicating with a GSO satellite at 23° 
East with an EIRP of 56 dBW. This might require coordination with the networks of 
other countries, and the starting point is derivation of the coordination contour. 
In this simplified example we calculate the total of the EIRP plus path loss using 
the propagation model in Appendix 7 of the Radio Regulations. The Mode 1 of this 
propagation model has been selected (propagation along great circles), configured 
for 0.01% of the time. The various zones the path crosses (sea, coastal, inland 
etc.) are extracted from the IDWM database.  
Note: If you don’t have access to IDWM you might see a slightly different contour. 
Three contours are given for the -160, -180, and -200 dBW as received at a test 
point with isotropic 0 dBi gain.  
Two windows are open:

This simulation shows Visualyse Professional deriving the area around a WiMAX 
base station where it would not be possible to deploy an Earth station receiving in 
C-band. 
It is based upon analysis relating to Agenda Item 1.4 as discussed at the WRC in 
November 2007. More information about this example is given in the associated 
“Visualyse Professional Version 7 Tutorial Document”. 
The WiMAX base station has been deployed near Sydney with 3 sectors and with 
power of 43 dBm within 10 MHz carrier. The C Earth station uses a 3m dish 
pointing at a satellite at 150°E. The interference is calculated taking into account 
the terrain using the propagation model in ITU-R Rec.P.452.  
The simulation can be used in two ways: 
1. Static analysis: the link budget shows the contributions of the interfering 
link budget and hence could be used for detailed coordination between a 
WiMAX network and a specific Earth station 
2. Exclusion zone analysis: using the Area Analysis, the locations where an 
Earth Station would suffer interference are identified and the level of 
interference at that point used to select the colour to fill in that pixel. 
The screen shot above shows three windows open, namely:

This example shows Visualyse Professional supporting the coordination of the 
gateway for a non-Geostationary satellite network with a number of nearby point to 
point fixed links. These could have been entered directly, read in using the FS 
import tool, or via the interface to the ITU’s terrestrial IFIC. 
The non-GSO network is assumed to be providing store and forward messaging 
services – these are known as “Little LEOs” due to the lower capacity than the 
voice and high-speed data of the “Big LEOs”. 
In this simulation, the gateway Earth Stations are uplink in L-band, co-frequency 
with a number of fixed service links. Interference at each of the FS receivers will 
vary depending upon: 
1. Gain of the gateway antenna (modelled using a Bessel function – real 
measured data could also be used) towards the FS link 
2. Path length and topography between the gateway and the FS receiver 
using a terrain database 
3. Change in atmospheric conditions using the propagation model in ITU-R 
Rec.P.452 
Hence the interference, measured as the I/N, will vary in time and it is necessary to 
run a simulation to work out the probability that various thresholds are met.

This example file shows an analysis of the impact of deployment probability on the 
interference that an Earth station would experience from a point to multi-point 
(PtMP) fixed service network. 
In this scenario a PtMP operator intends to provide communication services to 
fixed terminals on a frequency that is also used by an Earth station to receive 
downlinks. The PtMP operator must ensure it protects the ES, but it does not know 
where it will have customers in the future. 
One approach to determine the feasibility of deploying a base station at certain 
locations is to identify the probability that a deployment of user terminals (UTs) 
would cause interference. 
This is done by undertaking a Monte Carlo modelling approach that randomises 
the locations of the UTs across the PtMP operator service area. Other factors that 
could vary, such as propagation, are fixed, as they would vary in the time domain 
and this simulation is looking at probabilities relating to deployments. 
The screen shot above shows four windows open:

This example shows Visualyse Professional being used to support the planning of 
point to point (PtP) fixed links. A database of link positions has been entered – 
either directly or using one of: 
• 
Fixed service import tool 
• 
Station location import tool 
All links are co-frequency within the 28 GHz band and are using a bandwidth of 14 
MHz. The links have been planned using the rain fade model in ITU-R Rec.P.530-
16 using the rain rates in ITU-R Rec.P.837 and a percentage level of 0.01% - i.e. 
an availability target of 99.99%. 
The transmit power (and hence EIRP) have been selected so that the receive C/N 
is about 15 dB, which includes some interference and implementation margin 
against the target C/(N+I) of 13.5 dB. In this case we have assumed the 
implementation margin should be 1 dB so the target C/(N+I) is 14.5 dB. 
Interference paths have been set up so that the aggregate interference from all 
other links into each other is calculated using ITU-R Rec.P.452 and a terrain 
database. As the wanted link is set to deep fade, the interfering signal is assumed 
to be a median 50% of time level. 
The screen shot above shows four windows open:

Select “Propagation | Terrestrial Fixed” and try the following the changes: 
1. Analyse the median wanted signal level by changing the Rec.P.530 
percentage time to 50% and the Rec.P.452 percentage time to 0.01% as in 
the figures below. 
 
 
2. Analyse the changes in ITU-R Rec.P.530-16 over P.530-11 by changing 
the version number – it should be quite significant! This is because the rain 
rates in the revised version of Rec.P.837 for these locations are much 
higher.

This example that shows a GSO satellite with a single transmit spot beam. In its 
coverage are 6 receive earth stations, and links have been set up to model 
atmospheric effects such as gaseous absorption and rain fade. This uses the ITU-
R's relevant propagation models, Rec. 676 and Rec. 618. 
There are three windows: 
•

footprint and links. The links go red when a rain fade degrades the received 
signal. 
•

components of the propagation loss due to absorption and fading. 
•

The watch window also shows the calculation of the receive noise temperature on 
one of the links and shows how it increases due to rain noise – the double 
whammy effect of rain in lowering the wanted signal while increasing the noise. 
This simulation could be extended to allow detailed analysis of GSO links or GSO-
GSO interference subject to rain fading.

This example shows an example of how Visualyse Professional can support the 
coordination of GSO satellite networks. In this scenario there are two mobile 
satellite networks covering Europe and the US respectively. These are part of 
integrated mobile/terrestrial networks, and hence have little interest in maritime 
regions. A third operator wishes to take advantage of this but must coordinate with 
the other two networks. 
The coordination agreement is likely to take the form of a transmit EIRP 20 dB 
below that of the regional networks and with at least 6 dB antenna discrimination 
from land. The question is whether these tight constraints leave sufficient area 
over which service can be provided to make operation profitable. 
The simulation is configured with two windows open: 
• 
Map in Plate Carrée projection (left) showing the satellites, gain patterns, ship 
used as reference, and Area Analysis of the C/N 
• 
Watch window showing the wanted and interfering link budgets. 
The green area in the Visualyse Professional Area Analysis shows where the 
C/(N+I) is above 10 dB and hence service should be possible. The red area is 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 42 
 
 
 
where a marginal reduced service would be available. It can be seen that it is 
limited in area. 
One possibility to increase this area is to agree during coordination to use 
alternative polarisations – even though it is assumed this would only reduce 
unwanted signals by about 3 dB. 
If you: 
• 
Select “Interference Paths” from the icon / toolbar 
• 
Double click on “From other satellites” 
• 
Select “Advanced” 
• 
Under “Polarisation Advantage” select “User Defined” 
• 
Click “Ok” then “Close” 
The Area Analysis should then update with a significantly large area coloured in 
green as in the figure below. 
 
This could be sufficiently large an area to justify deployment if combined with 
services on other frequencies that can cover the ocean regions not covered by this 
network.

This example shows a satellite being transferred from low earth orbit into GSO. 
During this period, it is transmitting TT&C to ground control stations. As the orbit 
height increases it uses power control to maintain a constant received signal. To 
maintain constant communication, it hands over between ground control stations. 
While in transit it crosses a location with a large number of GSO beams which are 
transmitting on the same frequency. This causes the downlink to suffer 
interference as the TT&C stations point towards the GSO satellites. 
The following windows are open: 
• 
3D view (top right) showing the beams from the GSO satellites, the TT&C 
control stations and the satellite in transfer orbit. As the satellite move the hand 
overs between ground control stations can be seen. This link goes red when 
subject to interference from the GSO satellites.

This example shows graphically the coverage of a GSO satellite network over 
Europe. 
The satellite location and gain pattern are those for the LUX-28.2 satellite 
extracted from the ITU’s database via Visualyse Professional’s interface to SRS. 
The transmit power, bandwidth and frequency were also taken from SRS read 
using the SpaceCap tool. 
The link was set up to a reference earth station representing a TVRO service. The 
link was configured using an earth-space propagation model that included ITU-R 
Rec.676 for gaseous absorption and ITU-R Rec.618 for rain, using a percentage of 
time of 0.1%. Hence the link budget is calculated for an availability of 99.9% of 
time. 
The location of the test point was then varied using Visualyse Professional’s Area 
Analysis tool. Locations were then coloured depending upon whether the threshold 
of C/N > 10 dB for 99.9 % of time could be met as follows: 
Bright green: could be met with a 60 cm dish 
Dark green: could be met with an 80 cm dish 
Red: would require receive antenna greater than 80 cm. 
The simulation is configured with three views open:

The DT/T and C/I’s were then calculated at the reference earth station across the

This example considers interference from the uplink from an Earth Station on a 
Vessel (ESV) into terrestrial point to point fixed service (FS) links operating in the 
vicinity. The ESV is approaching the port of Seattle while transmitting and the 
amount of interference it could cause will depend upon the locations of the ship 
and FS receivers. 
The simulation has been configured with the movement of the ship defined using a 
series of way points. The interference from the ship at the fixed service receiver 
has been calculated taking into account the effect of terrain using the ITU-R 
Rec.P.452 propagation model. The wanted signal of the FS link is calculated 
taking into account fading due to multi-path and rain as in ITU-R Rec.P.530.

This example shows an example of Visualyse Professional modelling jamming. 
This is specialised form of interference that is deliberately generated to cause loss 
of service rather than (as is usually the case) unintentional. 
A number of jamming scenarios could be considered – indeed all the interference 
simulations in this document could be considered jamming if the motivation was 
hostile. This simulation shows an exercise where susceptibility of a missile’s 
telemetry to jamming was being tested.  
A missile is launch on a test trajectory across the Pacific Ocean, relaying data to 
ground via a network of satellites at X-band. In the exercise jamming station try to 
interrupt collection of data with a 10 kW transmission. The main mitigation method 
to the jamming attack is to switch to an alternative routing i.e. select a back-up 
satellite. 
The simulation is configured with three views open: 
•

jamming ground station, and the beam footprints

This example shows an example of Visualyse Professional modelling unmanned 
aerial vehicle, i.e. a UAV, including jamming. 
The UAV is sent on a mission to observe targets in the hills of Afghanistan. Its 
flight path is defined by a set of way points in (latitude, longitude, height). As it 
enters the mountainous region it climbs and then descends into valleys. 
Initially the communication is with the local field base: however soon the UAV is 
beyond range and instead a satellite link is used. The model also includes the 
complete end-to-end link back to the operations room in Washington DC. A range 
of frequency bands are used, including Ka for the UAV to satellite, V for the inter-
satellite, and S for the field base to UAV. 
At times during the mission the UAV suffers from jamming, and so the C/N is 
degraded. The model includes realistic modelling of propagation of wanted and 
interfering signals over terrain using ITU-R Rec.P.452 and a terrain database. 
The simulation is configured with four views open:

This example shows Visualyse Professional predicting the coverage a 3G network 
taking into account the effects of terrain and clutter. 
A number of base stations have been deployed along the M25 motorway south of 
London to provide voice and data services to vehicles i.e. using macro cells. These 
are transmitting at 2.1 GHz and the coverage uses ITU-R Rec.P.452 to predict 
signal levels and to take into account terrain. A land-use database is also used to 
derive clutter loss predictions at each pixel. 
The Area Analysis feature of Visualyse Professional has been used to show where 
there is usable signal strength according to the following scale:

It can be seen that coverage is generally better along the route of the motorway 
where the terrain is less hilly and there are little buildings. The coverage is reduced 
where there are hills or within the town of Sevenoaks where there is greater clutter 
loss.

This example shows an end to end communications link from a non-GSO satellite 
(in this case the international space station) to its control centre, routing via one of 
two data relay satellites. 
The space station selects which of the two tracking satellites to use and then the 
link down to the earth station starts at the end point of that link. As the space 
station moves the tracking satellite to use changes.  
Visualyse Professional derives the C/N for each of the individual hops and also the 
end to end link assuming a bent-pipe or non-regenerative payload so that the 
overall performance can be calculated using thermal addition. The earth-space 
paths include the attenuation due to atmospheric gases in ITU-R Rec.P.676. 
The simulation is configured with four views open:

satellites, the ground station, the current location of the space station, the 
ground track of the space station, and the footprints of the various beams.

This example file shows analysis of the increase in availability for navigation 
services of using an overlay from a constellation of satellites in Highly Eccentric 
Orbits (HEO). 
One objective of navigation services is to be able to provide accurate location 
within urban areas. However in cities there are likely to be tall buildings that 
obscure the view of the sky and hence reduce the number of satellites that can be 
used to gain a fix. This effect can be compensated by adding more satellites to the 
constellation, but this can be inefficient as any coverage improvement is by nature 
global. 
One possible solution that can bring significant coverage improvements without 
requiring large numbers of additional satellites is to provide an overlay using a 
HEO constellation. 
The screen shot above shows one such analysis, with four windows open: 
• 
3D view (top left), showing a Galileo like constellation of 27 satellites in 
circular orbit plus 4 in a HEO constellation, the ground tracks, and location 
of test point. The view point is that of one of the HEO satellites, so will 
change during the simulation as the satellite moves

Quick graph (top right) showing how the elevation angle of the tracked 
satellite varies with time 
• 
Statistics graph (bottom right) showing the cumulative distribution function 
of the links to the four highest circular orbit satellites and two highest HEO 
satellites  
It can be seen that both of the two highest HEO satellites are typically better than 
the 2nd highest circular orbit constellation satellite. Hence using a HEO overlay 
would significantly improve the statistics of the best four satellites required to make 
a fix.

This example shows an analysis of where a non-GSO satellite would suffer 
interference from a GSO network’s uplink. An earth station in the UK is transmitting 
to a GSO satellite on the same frequency as a non-GSO network. The question is 
where about in the non-GSO satellite’s orbit it would suffer interference. 
In this simulation a “floating” Area Analysis has been created with a test point at 
the same height as the non-GSO satellite. The PFD generated by the earth station 
as measured at the non-GSO satellite is then displayed with colour scheme that 
shows the intensity. Two areas can be seen: 
- 
in the main beam of the earth station just to the left of Spain 
- 
over the UK, nearby to the earth station from side-lobe interference 
The simulation is configured with three views open: 
• 
Plate Carrée view (right) showing the satellite, the earth station, the test 
point (small circle), the beams and the area analysis 
•

This example shows the calculation of Equivalent Power Flux Density (EPFD) from 
a constellation of satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) into a GSO satellite 
downlink. 
The GSO satellite is providing satellite TV services to small aperture receive 
dishes – here modelled as 60cm dishes using the gain pattern in ITU-R Rec.S.465. 
It is operating in Ku band where transmissions from non-GSO networks, including 
HEO, must meet the EPFD limits in Article 22.2 of the Radio Regulations. In this 
case the limit is -160 dBW/m^2/40 kHz, or -174 dBW/m^2/MHz. 
A HEO service proposes to operate co-frequency with the GSO network providing 
data services to VSATs using a series of spot beams to cover its main markets. 
The question is whether it would meet its requirements under 22.2. 
The simulation has four test points at various extrema of the GSO satellite 
downlink, and constellation was built using the HEO Wizard with a tracking 
strategy to select the active satellite. 
The screen shot above shows three windows: 
• 
Plate Carrée view (right) showing the locations of the satellites, Earth 
stations, links, beams, and the ground tracks of the HEO satellites.

steerable beams as required by the link. 
The simulation has been configured with a single 3D view showing the satellites, 
the beams, the gateway Earth Stations, and the satellite tracks. The view is fixed in

This example analysis the potential impact of introducing satellite radionavigation 
services such as Galileo into bands that are currently used for mobile satellite 
services such as Globalstar. 
The motivation was to facilitate the integration of satellite navigation features into 
3G enabled handsets by using adjacent frequency bands. As a primary band for 
3G is the 2 500 – 2 690 MHz, there would be clear advantages in having a satellite 
navigation signal at the adjacent band 2 483 – 2 500 MHz, currently used for 
mobile satellite services (MSS). However this could raise compatibility issues. 
This simulation includes two non-GSO constellations, one for the radionavigation 
service based upon Galileo parameters and another for the MSS service based 
upon Globalstar parameters. The constellations have been generated using 
Visualyse’s specialised wizard that takes account of the symmetry of the 
constellation: if actual orbit data was available in the Two-Line Element (TLE) 
format that could also be used. 
The MSS handset is selecting the highest satellite from its constellation, while an 
airborne user of the satellite radionavigation services is using the tracking 
strategies to select the four highest elevation satellites from its constellation.

This example shows sharing between two non-GSO constellations, using tracking 
strategies to meet regulatory requirements and to coordinate between themselves. 
Two non-GSO FSS networks are modelled in this simulation, namely the 288 
satellite Teledesic configuration and Celestri. It is assumed that the Celestri 
network, which filed after Teledesic, must protect the other from interference. In 
addition, the Celestri network is assumed to need to protect the GSO arc (either 
due to EPFD constraints in Article 22 or actual filed networks). 
One of the primary methods for a satellite network to protect another is to use 
pointing restrictions, which in Visualyse Professional are modelled in tracking 
strategies. In this example, there are two links with pointing constraints as follows: 
• 
Link 1: point at the highest elevation satellite from those that are at least 
16° above the horizon and at least 5° away from any point on the GSO arc 
• 
Link 2: point at the highest elevation satellite from those that are at least 
16° above the horizon and at least 5° away from any point on the GSO arc 
and at least 5° away from any of the Teledesic satellites 
Link 2 therefore has more vigorous constraints: the question this simulation is 
addressing is the implications on this on the constellation to provide a service. By 
analysing the statistics of number of satellites that meet the criteria, it can be 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 83 
 
 
 
determine the service that can be provided while protecting another constellation 
from interference.  
The simulation has the two links in different colour: most of the time they result in 
the earth station selecting the same satellite, but at times at which there would be 
an “in-line” event they diverge, with link 2 selecting a satellite that can be used 
without causing interference. 
At some very rare times no satellite meets the criteria needed for link 2. 
In the screen shot above there are four windows open: 
•

the earth station, and the two links, coloured red and yellow

constellations, the earth station, and the two links, coloured red and yellow

constellation that meets the criteria for Links 1 and 2 varies in time. Usually 
this is between 1 and 4, but sometimes the number of satellites that meets

• 
Statistics graph (bottom right) plotting the histogram of number of satellites

This example shows the original 840 satellite Teledesic constellation. This concept 
was developed in the 1990s to provide high speed broadband access globally 
using large numbers of satellites each of which would act as node and route traffic 
within the network.  
Teledesic was successful in gaining access to 2 x 400 MHz at WRC 95 and a 
further 2 x 100 MHz at WRC 97. However the challenges of implementation and 
most crucially funding such a system proved too great, even after reducing the size 
of the constellation down to 288 satellites, and the network never entered 
operation. 
The simulation only includes a single view showing the constellation in the 3D view 
together with space tracks. The congestion of the network around the poles can be 
seen – and the difficulty in avoiding collision and generation of space debris!

This example shows sharing between a High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) and 
terrestrial point to point Fixed Service station and satellite Earth Stations. 
The HAPS network has been configured with two sets of antennas: 
1. Multiple beam service link antenna 
2. Spot beam used as feeder to gateway station 
This example considers use of some of the upper parts of C band for the feeder 
link. It is assumed that this is shared with terrestrial receivers, which are modelled 
using ITU-R Rec.F.699 as the gain pattern and a range of locations (latitude, 
longitude) and pointing angles (azimuth, elevation). These could either come from 
real assignment data read in using one of: 
• 
Interface to the ITU-R’s database of terrestrial assignments (IFIC) 
• 
FS import tool using spreadsheet or CSV format data 
There are also a number of GSO satellite earth stations which could suffer 
interference from the HAPS.

This simulation shows an example of the analysis of the impact of using smart 
antennas. These can be used, for example, by base stations of mobile networks to 
improve performance. Rather than having fixed pointing and cover a fixed area – 
for example 90° of azimuth – a smart antenna creates a focussed beam of energy 
towards the wanted direction. 
In this simulation we have two base stations: 
1. Using conventional 120° sectors, with downtilt of 2° and peak gain 15 dBi 
2. Using a number (up to 25) narrow spot beams that point at a mobile as 
required with peak gain 30 dBi 
Within the cell of each base station there located at random two mobile stations, 
and a link is set up using 3G/WCDMA parameters to close the link for a C/N of 
around 12.5 dB using power control to determine an appropriate transmit power. 
Within this scenario two issues are being addressed: 
• 
Which case would create the highest interference towards other receivers 
co-frequency? 
• 
Which case would provide the least intra-system interference and hence 
could provide the highest capacity? 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 89 
 
 
 
This is analysed by running a Monte Carlo style analysis and producing statistics 
of I/N at a victim receiver or C/(N+I) for each mobile link assuming the other mobile 
link also causes interference. It is assumed the intra-system interference path can 
use orthogonal coding to reduce interference by 10 dB. 
Both the wanted and interfering paths are assumed to use the Hata / COST 231 
propagation models and operate at a frequency of 2 GHz. 
In the screen shot above there are four windows open: 
•

the mobiles they are services, their beams, and the test point. 
•

I/N from each of the two base stations into the receive test point. It can be 
seen that for all percentages of time the smart antenna base station causes 
lower levels of interference

of the C/(N+I) for one mobiles for each of the base station taking into

3.10.3 Traffic and Exclusion Zone

Station types: 
Mobile, Radio astronomy 
Propagation models: 
Hata / COST231 
 
This example demonstrates how the Traffic module can be used to model more 
accurately the behaviour of a mobile network. 
A mobile operator wants to deploy at base station in UHF band that would receive 
uplinks from mobile users in a channel adjacent to that used by the radio 
astronomy service (RAS). This service has very stringent protection requirements: 
Recommendation ITU-R RA.769 suggests a threshold of -202 dBW/MHz at the 
receiver for no more than 2% of time. 
One way to protect the radio astronomy service is to employ an exclusion zone, 
and the mobile operator is suggesting one with radius 5 km would be sufficient. 
The question is how to test that assumption. 
Interference from the uplink can be very variable due the randomisation of the 
number of active users and their location within the cell. In Visualyse Professional 
this can be modelled using the Define Variable and the Traffic Module, which can 
also be used to define an Exclusion Zone. 
In this case a traffic object is defined such that a mobile user is active for 25% of 
the time and never when within 5 km of the RAS site. A variable definition is used 
to randomise the position of 12 users within a hexagonal cell. 
We have assumed the base station at the centre of the cell and is located just 
outside the exclusion zone, being 6 km away. Power control is used on the uplink 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 91 
 
 
 
and the COST 231 / Hata propagation model used for both wanted and interfering 
paths.  
The RAS is assumed to be operating in UHF channel 38, while the mobiles are in 
channel 37, so this is an adjacent band analysis. A fixed attenuation of 40 dB is 
assumed between the 5 MHz WCMDA carrier and a 1 MHz reference receiver 
bandwidth. 
In the screen shot above there are five windows open: 
• 
Model view (top left) showing the various simulation objects in a “file 
explorer” like display 
• 
Mercator map view (top right) showing the locations of the radio astronomy 
site, the base station, the mobiles, the active links, and the exclusion zone. 
Grid lines are every 2 km 
• 
Statistics graph (bottom left) showing the cumulative distribution function 
(CDF) of interference at the radio astronomy site, with the threshold from 
ITU-R Rec.RA.769 as a marker. Note how the CDF never reaches 100% 
as there are times when no mobiles outside the exclusion zones are active 
• 
Watch window (bottom centre) showing the number of interfering entries, 
the total interference, the I/N at the RAS site, and the percentage of time 
interference would occur 
• 
Path profile window (bottom right) showing path from the radio astronomy 
site to the worst single interferer 
If you run the simulation you will see the interference exceeds the radio astronomy 
threshold by around 10 dB and so further mitigation would be required. One simple 
additional step would be to consider the effect of terrain and clutter. 
Note also how the number of interferers changes due to variation in number of 
active users and whether they are within the exclusion zone or not.

There are a number of bands that are or could be used for Electronic News 
Gathering (ENG). This example considers one such, use of the licence exempt 2.4 
GHz band for ENG. 
This is also widely used for wireless access networks using the 802.11 standard, 
Wi-Fi. The question is then what is the implication of widespread use of the 2.4 
GHz band by ENG transmitters. 
The scenario considers two Wi-Fi networks, with central node and remote user. 
The coverage is predicted using a dual slope propagation model based upon ITU-
R Rec.P.1791. The simulation considers the downlink direction: it would also be 
necessary to consider the uplink in more detailed analysis. 
An ENG is modelled as transmitting pointing directly at one of the Wi-Fi nodes, and 
the impact on coverage modelled taking into account this source of interference. 
The interference between the Wi-Fi networks is also included. It can be seen that 
the coverage of the Wi-Fi network is severely reduced by the impact of the ENG, 
while there is only minor reduction in coverage due to one Wi-Fi node on another2. 
The figure above shows two windows open:

spectrum between nearby Wi-Fi networks.

3.11 PCS / AWS 
On the 18th September 2006, the FCC’s Auction 66 completed, releasing the 
1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands for Advanced Wireless Services 
(AWS). This opened up new swaths of spectrum for advanced PCS applications, 
ranging from web browsing to TV, direct to any suitable handset.  
However, these bands have a significant number of incumbents, including 
government (typically military) and private wireless services – in particular fixed 
links. These existing services have rights that are protected under Title 47 Part 24 
of the Code of Federal Regulations, in which the FCC requires that new entrants 
do not cause them harmful interference. Furthermore the new entrants must 
accept interference into their networks from existing licensed systems.  
In order to be able to provide a widespread high quality network it is important to 
be able to analyse this sharing scenario accurately, in order to: 
• 
Identify scenarios where interference between PCS and incumbents would 
be acceptable 
• 
Identify scenarios where interference between PCS and incumbents would 
not be acceptable 
• 
Identify strategies that could be used to facilitate sharing in problem cases 
• 
Support the migration of existing services to other bands if necessary 
• 
Potentially offer ability to automate technical coordination via on-line web 
service 
This section describes how Visualyse Professional could be used to support such 
analysis and contains the following examples: 
• 
Analysis of FS into mobile RX 
• 
PCS-FS Demo - BS TX 
• 
PCS-FS Demo - MS TX 
Note that this sort of analysis could be used in other bands and in other

This example shows Visualyse Professional identifying the area where the 
downlink of a mobile network would suffer interference from a fixed service link. 
The simulation contains two connected point to point fixed links in the area South-
East of Washington DC. Around Richmond the PCS licence holder has deployed a 
grid of base stations and would like to identify those areas that could be affected 
by the fixed link. 
The fixed link can be included in the simulation either by entering the parameters 
by hand, using the spreadsheet based FS import tool, or using the terrestrial IFIC 
interface (if the data is available). 
An Area Analysis has been created that shows locations where the I/N would 
exceed -6 dB, i.e. increase the noise figure by 1 dB. At each pixel the interfering 
signal is calculated using the propagation model in ITU-R Rec.P.452 using a 
terrain database to derive path profiles.

This example shows a scenario considering interference in the other direction – 
from the new entrant PCS/AWS network into an incumbent FS network, in 
particular from the downlink, Base Station (BS) transmit case. 
The mobile operator has deployed a network of base stations in the area of 
Richmond South East of Washington DC and needs to identify the interference it 
would cause into the FS receivers. 
There a number of ways in which the BS locations could be entered – either 
manually, using the hexagonal service area wizard, or if locations are known, using 
a CSV file containing (latitude, longitudes). 
The base station antennas could be defined using standard patterns such as ITU-
R Rec.F.1336 or in tables if available from the manufacturer such as in the figure 
below that shows the elevation slice of a pattern that uses downtilt.

The fixed links have been modelled using the fade model in ITU-R Rec.P.530, but 
Visualyse Professional also includes the TIA Bulletin 10F fade model. 
The screen show above shows four windows open:

As the simulation is static there is no need to run the simulation – the results are 
given directly in the watch windows. The simulation could be extended to do C/I 
analysis using Monte Carlo methods to convolve fading on the fixed link with 
variations in interfering signal due to propagation and traffic variation.

This example considers interference from the mobile uplink direction into a point to 
point fixed link. This requires Monte Carlo modelling methods, as there can be 
significant variation in interference due to variations in: 
• 
Mobile traffic level 
• 
Mobile location altering the gain at the FS receiver 
• 
Mobile location varying the distance and path profile between mobile and 
FS receiver 
• 
Mobile location impacting the EIRP when using power control 
• 
Propagation conditions  
This type of modelling can be easily done in Visualyse Professional using the 
Define Variable module to randomise various input parameters. The simulation has 
been created with a hexagonal grid of 23 base stations. Each base station is 
assumed to support 30 mobiles, making a total of 690 across the service area. 
The location of each mobile has been randomised as has the percentage of time 
used in the propagation model in ITU-R Rec.P.452, which takes account of the 
terrain database. In this case the EIRP has been fixed at -6 dBW, i.e. -24 dBm, but 
more advanced simulations could use power control to meet the required quality of 
service. 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 100 
 
 
 
In Monte Carlo modelling the interfering level will vary from time step to time step – 
from sample to sample. Hence the simulation must be run for a number of samples 
and statistics generated. In this case the key output is the cumulative distribution 
function (CDF) of the I/N at the FS receiver. 
The simulation has been configured to run for 999 time steps to generate 1,000 
samples, but it can be run for longer to get statistics for the smaller percentages of 
time. 
The resulting I/N statistics can be used to determine whether the probabilistic 
interference thresholds have been met. These are typically of the form: 
• 
Long term: I/N > -20 dB for no more than 20% of the time 
• 
Short time: I/N > 18 dB for no more than 0.01% of the time

This example file analyses sharing issues related to siting of wind farms near 
radars. There is concern that the rotating blades of the turbines would create 
reflections that would be hard to filter out and hence reduce the radar’s 
effectiveness. 
The issues were addressed in the report “The Effect of Windmill Farms On Military 
Readiness” prepared for the Congressional Defense Committees. It identified a 
number of mitigation methods, but suggested that the only reliable one was to 
avoid radar line of sight: 
“The mitigations that exist at present to completely preclude any adverse 
impacts on air defense radars are limited to those methods that avoid 
locating the wind turbines in radar line of sight of such radars. These 
mitigations may be achieved by distance, terrain masking, or terrain relief 
and requires case-by-case analysis.” 
This simulation file shows how to generate in Visualyse Professional the exclusion 
zone around an existing radar site where wind farms should not located. 
The method is based upon using a terrain database together with the ITU-R 
Rec.P.526 diffraction model. Where there is no diffraction the path is classified as 
with the radio line of sight and hence should be part of the exclusion zone. This 
uses Visualyse Professional’s Area Analysis tool.

This example analyses the potential to use bands used for maritime radars for 
terrestrial mobile services at around 2.9 GHz. This is just above the top of the band 
2.5 – 2.69 GHz which is allocated to terrestrial mobile, particularly IMT-2000. It 
would be useful if 3G services could expand into higher frequencies, but there is 
the danger of interference from radars. However, if these radars are located on the 
coastline to provide maritime surveillance then there might be the potential to 
operate inland.  
This example identifies the areas where there could be interference from the radar 
that could exceed an interference threshold of an I/N = -10 dB at a base station, 
i.e. considering the mobile uplink. A similar analysis could also be done with the 
downlink. 
A particular characteristic of this scenario is the extreme variation in signal from 
the radar, due to: 
1. Pulsed nature of signal at the very small scale of time 
2. Sweeping of the antenna with rotations in the order of a second or seconds 
3. Propagation variation between radar site and receiver over periods of 
months or a year 
One method to undertake analysis to identify those regions that would suffer 
interference due radar antenna main beam or far side-lobe interference, i.e. 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 105 
 
 
 
eliminate the 2nd of these two variations. The impact of the first of these is likely to 
depend upon details of the victim system, in particular is susceptibility to pulsed 
interference, hence can be considered separately. 
Hence for the purposes of this simulation two exclusion zones are identified: those 
where the I/N threshold is exceeded by main beam interference and those where it 
is exceeded even for far side lobes. In both cases we are considering the level that 
not be exceeded for more than 1% of the time due to propagation variation. The 
exclusion zones were generated using the Area Analysis tool. 
The screen shot above shows three views open:

At WRC 2003 PFD limits of –115 dBW / m^2 / 10 MHz for no more than 1% of time 
were agreed in Article 5.502 of the Radio Regulations. Recently Study Group 4 
has agreed S.1712 which contains “Methodologies for determining whether an 
FSS earth station at a given location could transmit in the band 13.75-14 GHz 
without exceeding the pfd limits in No. 5.502 of the Radio Regulations, and 
guidelines to mitigate excesses”. 
This example shows how Visualyse Professional can be used to undertake 
analysis using the methodologies this Recommendation describes, in particular 
Method 2 in Annex 2, creation of a contour showing the locations where operation 
is acceptable as it would not exceed the PFD limits; 
Visualyse Professional can also be used for analysis under Method 3 in Annex 3 to 
determine whether a specific location can be used or whether it would exceed the 
PFD limits. More information is given in a Technical Note available on request, 
which goes into this sharing scenario in a little more depth. 
The aim of this simulation is to identify those locations where it would be feasible 
to locate a satellite Earth station and not trigger the PFD limits along a national 
border or, as in this case, a coastline. This was done by: 
• 
Creating a reference satellite Earth station including antenna gain pattern 
using ITU-R Rec.S.465 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 107 
 
 
 
• 
Creating a set of test points around the coastline and get them to transmit 
with the same EIRP as the satellite Earth station (this task can be assisted 
by Visualyse Professional’s service area wizard that can create test points 
along a country’s border). 
• 
Moving the reference satellite Earth station across the area of interest 
• 
At each pixel within the area of interest, calculating the interference from 
the test points at the Earth station and taking the worst (i.e. highest value). 
This corresponds to the highest power at the coastline from a transmitting 
Earth station at that location 
• 
Colouring in that pixel according to the highest signal at the test point from 
the coastline (i.e. the highest power at the coastline from the test point) 
The figure above shows the resulting Area Analysis. The colour scheme chosen 
was: 
Yellow: interference exceeds the threshold but by less than 20 dB. Hence 
operation at these points might be feasible if site shielding is used 
Red: interference exceeds the threshold by at least 20 dB. Hence operation at 
these points is unlikely to be approved. 
Note the simulation used a 1 km grid and low resolution terrain database: the 
prediction could be improved using higher resolution terrain data and maybe also a 
land use database to predict clutter loss. 
Export to Google Earth can be used to identify those locations where operation 
would be permitted, as in the example below.

This example shows an example of analysis of the power flux density (PFD) mask 
that can protect terrestrial point to point fixed link from interference from 
constellations of satellites in highly eccentric orbits (HEO). 
It is proposed that a PFD limits be -105 dBW / m^2 / MHz for elevation angles of 
arrival less 5°, -115 dBW / m^2 / MHz for elevation angles above 25°, and linear 
interpolation between 5° and 25°. 
The interference that this PFD mask will generate will depend upon the 
characteristics of the satellite constellation. Therefore to check whether the mask 
is suitable not it is necessary to run a simulation assuming it applies and checking 
the predicted levels of interference. 
The interference will also depend upon the characteristics of the FS receiver: in 
particular its: 
• 
Latitude 
• 
Longitude 
• 
Antenna azimuth 
• 
Antenna gain pattern 
• 
Antenna height 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 111 
 
 
 
In this example, we consider a single location, height and gain pattern and vary the 
azimuth, but other runs could analyse the impact of vary other parameters. 
Interference is measured in terms of the I/N at the FS receiver and compared 
against a threshold I/N = -10 dB. Statistics are captured on what percentage of 
time this threshold is exceeded, and in addition what the worst I/N would be. Other 
statistics could be generated, such as the Fractional Degradation in Performance 
(FDP). 
A 3-satellite HEO constellation is modelled with repeat period and hence 
simulation duration of 1 day, using a 10 second time step. 
The screen shot above shows the following windows: 
• 
Table view (far left) showing the azimuth angles of the test FS receivers, 
varying from 0° to 90° in 2.5° steps

receiver with the highest probability of interference!

This example analyses interference with a satellite network employing Auxiliary 
Terrestrial Component (ATC). This is used to extend and improve the coverage 
and capacity of the satellite network, particularly in urban areas where there can 
be significant reduction in coverage due to clutter (see next example file for 
details). 
To improve performance in urban areas, terrestrial repeaters or base stations are 
deployed, typically operating within the spectrum allocated to the satellite system. 
However this can result in interference if not managed correctly – either within the 
satellite / ATC network or into other networks either co-frequency or in adjacent 
bands. 
One of the key strengths of Visualyse Professional is how it can analyse the 
various combinations of satellite and terrestrial systems. In this example file it is 
analysing both Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL) and both satellite and terrestrial 
services in the same simulation file!  
The various elements are shown in the following two figures. There are two sets of 
wanted paths: 
• 
Space to Earth path between the satellite and the handsets operating in 
satellite mode, modelling used free space path loss and gaseous 
attenuation using Rec.P.676 plus 10 dB of clutter loss

• 
Terrestrial path between the ATC base stations and the handsets operating 
in GSM mode, modelling the short range urban path using the Hata / COST 
231 propagation model 
The first figure considers the downlink interference paths including: 
• 
Space to Earth path: interference from the satellite DL into the ATC 
terrestrial component DL, modelling used free space path loss and 
gaseous attenuation using Rec.P.676 
•

The simulation has been configured so that all links would work with adequate C/N 
in the absence of interference. However it can be seen that for three of the four 
interference paths the C/I is significantly negative. 
The screen shot above shows four windows open: 
•

and base stations, and beam foot print of the satellite network (note only a

•

This example show Visualyse Professional being used to predict the coverage of a 
GSO satellite providing communication services and broadcasting multi-media to 
mobiles in urban areas. This can be problematic for areas of Europe, as the GSO 
arc is low on the horizon for the higher latitudes involved. This means that the 
direct path to the satellite is more likely to be obscured by a building, and in these 
cases with the minimal margin available the link will fail. 
In this case an urban area has been created using the generic terrain file format 
containing streets between blocks, towers, plazas, and a river with bridges. Using 
only the GSO satellite the coverage is limited, particularly behind the towers, 
where there is considerable shadowing. To provide fill-in of these locations a 
terrestrial repeater has been included: the propagation has been modelled using 
the “over the top” path included in ITU-R Rec.P.452. 
Two area analysis have been created: 
1. Dark green: showing where the C/N from the satellite exceeds 12 dB 
2. Light green: showing where the C/N from either the satellite or the 
terrestrial repeater exceeds 12 dB 
The locations that are uncoloured show where there is coverage from neither the 
repeater nor the satellite. 
In the screen shot above there are four windows open:

Action:

Modules used:

Terrain regions:

Frequency band: 
Ka 
Station types: 
Fixed, Mobile 
Propagation models: 
ITU-R Rec. P.1791 
 
This example shows study of the impact of short range radars (SRRs) on point to 
point fixed links around 26 GHz. 
A fixed service receiver station is modelled at the centre of the test area. Its 
antenna is modelled using the Rec.P.699 gain pattern with azimuth = 90° (due 
East) and elevation just below horizontal (-0.75°).  
In the vicinity of this FS receiver are assumed to be a number of roads on which 
are vehicles. These have been modelled by randomising the position (lat, long) 
using the Define Variable module.  
It is assumed there are two roads running North-South, one East-West and several 
other small roads modelled as vehicles at random locations across the area of 
interest. 
Note that the task of defining these roads with all these vehicles is simplified by the 
use of the duplicate feature! This sort of randomisation makes this a Monte Carlo 
style simulation. 
The SRRs are assumed to be transmitting at -73 dBW: this is -43 dBm / MHz as 
per FCC requirements plus two factors: 
• 
3 dB increase due to the gain at the transmit antenna 
• 
3 dB increase due to multiple transmitters on the vehicle 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 119 
 
 
 
The net result is an equivalent EIRP per vehicle of -37 dBm or -67 dBW. 
The propagation model is assumed to be dual slope with decay factor 2 until 1 km 
and then 3. 
The figure above shows four windows: 
• 
Mercator view (top left) showing the location of stations on a grid every 1

This example shows sharing between a Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth (BT) at 
around 2.4 GHz. 
The simulation operates at short ranges with maximum radius of Wi-Fi network of 
50m and paired BT devices 1 metre apart. The location of the user terminal is 
randomised within the Wi-Fi service area as is the paired BT device. 
The wanted and interfering paths are assumed to use the propagation model in 
ITU-R Rec.P.1791, which is a dual slope model plus log-normal fading. 
The Wi-Fi network is operating on one of the three non-overlapping 22 MHz 
channels while the BT device bandwidth is 1 MHz and is frequency hopping. BT 
devices can hop over all three channels but tend to avoid those where they suffer 
interference – such as when co-frequency with Wi-Fi networks. Hence in this 
example it is assume to hop at random outside the Wi-Fi’s channel. 
Representative spectrum masks of both the Wi-Fi and BT have been used and for 
a given frequency offset Visualyse Professional 7 calculates the net filter 
discrimination (NFD). 
An additional factor modelled is the activity ratio of the BT device which is 
assumed to be active for 25% of the time. Hence the simulation calculates the 
performance using Monte Carlo methods to convolve: 
• 
Randomisation of location 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 121 
 
 
 
• 
Randomisation of fading on wanted paths 
• 
Randomisation of fading on interfering paths 
• 
Random selection of frequency of BT operation, and hence relative 
frequency offset, and hence variation in NFD 
• 
Random activation of BT link 
The result is degradation in performance of each link due to the other. The figure 
above shows four windows: 
• 
Mercator view (top left) showing the location of stations on a grid every 
10m for scale 
• 
Frequency view (bottom left) showing the spectrum mask of the BT (as 
interferer) and receive filter mask of the Wi-Fi (as victim) 
• 
Watch window (top right) showing the wanted and interfering link budgets 
•

Modules used:

Frequency band: 
X 
Station types: 
Non-GSO Satellite, Earth Station 
Propagation models: 
Free Space 
 
This example considers the case of a non-GSO satellite being used for remote 
sensing applications. It is downloading using a directional antenna to an Earth 
Station in the centre of a large country (India) but there is still the potential to 
exceed the relevant PFD limits. 
These are defined in Article 21 of the Radio Regulations and for the part of X band 
under consideration, namely around 8 GHz, the limits are: 
• 
-140 dBW/m^2/4 kHz for elevation angles greater than 25° 
• 
Linear interpolation between -140 and -150 dBW/m^2/4 kHz for elevation 
angles between 5° and 25° 
• 
-150 dBW/m^2/4 kHz for elevation angles less than 5° 
The Radio Regulations give each Administration the right to exceed these levels 
within their own territory. The question is then would these PFD limits be exceeded 
in adjacent countries? 
This simulation shows how Visualyse Professional can help analyse these 
problems. A set of test points have been defined around the border of a 
neighbouring country, Pakistan, and the PFD at each test point calculated as the 
satellite moves along its orbit. 
The figure above shows four windows:

Page 124 
 
 
 
• 
3D view (top left) showing the non-GSO satellite, its orbit track, the Earth 
Station, the beam from the non-GSO satellite to Earth Station, and the test

•

its orbit track, the Earth Station, the beam from the non-GSO satellite to 
Earth Station, and the test points around the adjacent country 
• 
Watch window (bottom right) showing the PFD calculation for one of the 
test points, the worst PFD over all the test points, and the link budget for 
the X-band downlink 
• 
Statistics graph (top right) showing the cumulative distribution function of 
the worst PFD at each time step and the CDF of the PFD for one test point 
(number 39) 
Note that the non-GSO satellite only transmits when it can see the Earth Station 
and the PFD statistics are only updated when the non-GSO satellite is transmitting 
and can see the test points: hence the statistics are unlikely to be valid for more 
than 10% of the time. However in this case it can be seen that the PFD limits are 
met as the PFD never exceeds -150 dBW/m^2/4 kHz. 
This simulation can be extended to undertake more advanced analysis which 
takes account of how the PFD varies with elevation angle.

3.15.2 P-MP FS into EESS (passive) 
Action:

Modules used: 
Define Variable

None 
Frequency band: 
Ku 
Station types: 
Non-GSO Satellite, Fixed 
Propagation models: 
Free space path loss, ITU-R Rec.P.676 
 
This example shows analysis from large numbers of terrestrial transmitters into a 
passive space-borne sensor. In this example it involves Ku band point to multi-
point (P-MP) fixed service base station interfering with a satellite sensor. There are 
many other possible examples – including RLANs at 5 GHz into non-GSO MSS 
feeder links and Ka band SRR into EESS sensors. 
In this example 105 P-MP base stations have been deployed across Europe. Their 
antenna is omni-directional with elevation dependency as in the figure below: 
Demonstration Files 
 
Page 126 
 
 
 
 
This uses one of the P-MP gain patterns in ITU-R Rec.F.1336. Each one is 
transmitting at 40 dBm i.e. 10 dBW across a WiMAX channel bandwidth of 10 
MHz. 
A remote sensing satellite is in orbit overhead, with sensor moving in pre-defined 
angles using the Define Variable Module. As it flies over Europe is suffers 
interference at its receiver, measured using the I/N metric. 
The screen-shot above shows the following windows: 
• 
3D view (top left): showing the locations of the P-MP base stations, the 
satellite, its beam, and its space track 
• 
Plate Carrée map (bottom left): showing the locations of the P-MP base 
stations, the satellite, its beam, and its ground track 
• 
Watch window (top right): showing the link budget for the worst single 
interfering P-MP base station and the aggregation of all visible interferers 
• 
Quick graph (bottom right): showing how the I/N varies with time as the 
satellite flies over 
It can be seen that in this case the I/N peaks at around 10.8 dB – which could 
cause significant data loss.

This example shows how the pointing angles of sensors can be defined in a range 
of different ways in Visualyse Professional. In this example the sensors are on a 
non-GSO satellite – for example a remote sensing satellite – but they could be on 
any station type. 
There are four satellites each using a different method to point their sensor: 
1. Fixed pointing: the sensor points with (az, el) = (40°, 0°) for the duration of 
the simulation 
2. Swept broom pointing: the sensor scans back and forth between (az, el) 
angles of (-40°, 0°) and (+40°, 0°) at a rate of 1° per second 
3. Rotating: the sensor scans round around through-out 360° at a fixed 
elevation angle – in this case -55° – at a scan rate of 1° per second. Note 
that the scan platform was rotated through -90° of pitch using the Euler 
angles under “Advanced” so the rotation is around the required axis 
4. Pre-defined: the Define Variable Module was used to vary the pointing to 
specific locations at pre-defined times with interpolation between angles 
defined in the look-up tables 
The simulation has been configured with three windows open:
