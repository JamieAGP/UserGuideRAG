Introduction 
Welcome to the Visualyse Professional User Guide 
Visualyse Professional is a software tool that allows you to simulate a wide 
range of radiocommunication systems, and the potential interference levels 
between them. This User Guide provides all the information you need to operate 
the software.  
In other documents you will find the User Guide for the add-on Modules, a 
Tutorial, a Technical Annex giving background to the calculations, and a 
description of each of the example files. 
Our assumptions about you, the User are that you are an engineer of some kind 
and that your understanding of radio systems and interference issues is good. 
We assume that you are mainly looking for guidance on the operation of the 
software. 
Therefore the main aim of this Guide is to show you how to map your real world 
understanding onto the abstract models and concepts in Visualyse. This is 
relatively easy to do as the concepts and models in Visualyse are based on our 
analysis of the real world of radiocommunications, and we anticipate significant 
overlap between our world and yours. 
We recommend that you read at least the overview section thoroughly. Other 
sections of this User Guide can be used as reference books when you are 
building and editing your simulations. If you are a typical user you will be able to 
make some good progress by experimenting with the software itself – perhaps 
after having followed the Tutorial. 
This section of the User Guide gives an overview of the software. It explains at a 
high level what the software can do and also serves as a road map to rest of the 
guides. 
Other sources of information include: 
• 
The example files shipped with the software, plus the document describing 
them 
• 
Telephone technical support (if you have a current Annual Maintenance 
and Support contract) 
• 
Web site:  
http://www.transfinite.com   
• 
User group newsletter – issued periodically to everyone with an Annual 
Maintenance and Support Contract 
• 
Training courses – by arrangement with the Transfinite Systems

About The User Guide 
1.1.1 
What is Visualyse Professional? 
Visualyse Professional has been designed to simulate radio systems and to 
analyse potential interference between such systems. 
Visualyse will allow you to faithfully model many types of radio system and 
provides support for the definition of terrestrial networks, space based systems, 
radar, fixed and mobile communications. 
User Guide 
 
Page 7 
 
 
 
Its range of built-in antenna and propagation models means that most of the 
time the elements needed to model your system, even if the systems as a whole 
is innovating and new, are already there and you simply pick them from list. 
Increasingly we find that people are using Visualyse for other types of modelling, 
and this is possible due to the open and flexible design of the software. 
Visualyse can be used for many other types of analysis, and users are 
supported in this by the graphical feedback, the possibility to track and analyse 
internal variables and the simple underlying model that the software uses. 
Graphical Feedback 
An important feature of Visualyse is the graphical interface and the animated 
interactive views. The feedback from these views allows complex simulations to 
be set-up and more easily verified. 
You will see immediately if you create a station or a link and it is not in the 
location you intended. The dynamics of your scenario can be displayed on a 
variety of map projections.  
Graphs showing the evolution of any variable 
or statistical information on any variable are 
also interactively updated. 
Not a Black Box 
Engineering software is often presented as a 
black box system. This means that you set up 
your input and the software tells you an 
answer, with little or no explanation. In some 
applications you may see improvements on this 
and have results presented at several levels of 
detail. 
In Visualyse, details of every calculation can be displayed and analysed - using 
Model Views, Table Views and Watch Windows and in statistical form as 
histograms or cumulative distributions. This is true for every variable whether 
specified as an initial input (it may after all evolve), whether a direct output, or 
whether part of some intermediate calculation. 
Any variable can be written to a text file and logged at each time step for 
external analysis and processing if necessary. This option allows you to 
completely verify the calculations against external standards. 
Object Orientation 
The data needed to define a simulation are entered via a series of dialogs: one 
for each of the Visualyse modelling elements. The modelling elements reflect 
real world objects and concepts from radiocommunications. 
As such, communications engineers should be familiar with the modelling 
concepts with Visualyse and may find the software intuitive and simple to use. 
The next sections explain this main function of Visualyse, as an interference 
analysis tool. Section 1.1.2.5 outlines some of the other uses of the software. 
1.1.2 
Visualyse as an Interference Analysis Tool 
The structure of Visualyse reflects its core function as an interference analysis 
tool. User defined elements are the basic building blocks. These elements 
include Antennas, Carriers, Stations and Links. 
The flexible and open nature of 
the software means that it can 
be used for many purposes 
beyond the core functions of 
interference analysis. Once you 
are familiar with the structure 
of the tool, you will begin to 
find many applications for it. 
User Guide 
 
Page 8 
 
 
 
An overview of how the building blocks fit together is described in Section 2. 
1.1.2.1 Basic Modelling Elements 
The basic process in setting up interference scenarios is to define radio stations 
and to link them together – Visualyse includes objects called Stations and Links.  
In the real world stations use antennas and so Visualyse has an Antenna object 
to model the behaviour of antennas. A Station in Visualyse is defined by a 
location, rules for its movement and the antennas it uses and how it points them. 
Links can be defined by a start and end Station and include details of EIRP, 
Frequency and each has a specified Carrier.  
Having defined the basic modelling elements, Links can then be selected as 
wanted or interfering (or both), and this reflects our experience of how spectrum 
sharing and interference analysis studies are conceptualised. 
Antennas, Carriers, Stations and Links contain almost all the information needed 
to perform interference calculations. 
Stations and Links can be placed into Groups e.g. satellite constellations can be 
treated as a single Group of Stations, multiple uplinks to a single satellite can be 
treated as a Group of Links. Analysis of Groups of Stations and Links allows 
large scenarios to be analysed more easily. 
1.1.2.2 Define the Required Output 
Interference can be analysed in terms of: 
• 
C – the wanted carrier level 
• 
I – the interfering carrier level 
• 
N – the wanted system noise 
• 
C/I 
• 
C/N 
• 
C/N+I 
• 
I/N 
• 
PFD – the Power Flux Density  
• 
EPFD – the Equivalent Power Flux Density 
Interference can be from a single source or aggregated from multiple antennas 
on multiple Stations. 
Where interference or wanted signal levels vary with time (due to the motion of 
stations, signal fading or perhaps some other time dependent effect), Visualyse 
can collect and display statistical information.  
1.1.2.3 Propagation Modelling 
In Visualyse Professional Version 7 you can select from 22 propagation models 
and apply them alone or in combination to Visualyse Links. 
As different models may apply in different environments, you can define any 
number of link ‘Types’ and have a different set of propagation conditions for 
each. By default you will see there are the following Link Types:

Broadcasting 
1.1.2.4 Interference Calculation 
The interference calculation that Visualyse performs requires you to specify: 
1. Your wanted or victim link(s) 
2. The unwanted or interfering link(s) 
3. A number of calculation options 
In default configuration the software will take the carrier centre frequency and 
bandwidth that you have specified and calculate the overlap between the 
wanted and unwanted carriers. 
It will perform an aggregation based on the power sum of all the unwanted 
sources, taking into account their relative power levels, antenna gain (calculated 
based on geometry), path loss etc. 
There are a number of additional factors that can be included in the calculation. 
For example: 
• 
The net filter discrimination calculated from the transmit and receive 
spectrum masks 
• 
Polarisation isolation  
• 
Possible multiple hits from a narrow band unwanted carrier to a broadband 
wanted 
• 
Radar ‘on tune rejection’. 
1.1.2.5 Build on Simple Foundations  
Although based on the combination of very simple elements, it is very easy to 
create scenarios that are large and complex using Visualyse. 
The software supports you in the complex analysis through: 
• 
Grouping of Station and Link objects 
• 
Use of Wizards to create and modify groups – for example, the Service 
Area Wizard that allows you to create (among other things) large numbers 
of hexagonally deployed terrestrial stations, or the Link to Service Area 
Wizard that will allow you to connect all these Stations in multiple Links. 
• 
Import of data from various external sources, including the space and 
terrestrial IFICs or from a simply formatted grid (or CSV file) that you can 
define and edit in your windows compatible spreadsheet. 
• 
Definition of ‘Dynamic Links’ and complex ‘Tracking Strategies’ that allow 
you to model networks that may include handover  
• 
Modelling traffic variations (with use of the Traffic Module) 
User Guide 
 
Page 10 
 
 
 
• 
Use of Monte-Carlo modelling for any variable (with use of the Define 
Variable Module) 
• 
Use of terrain data, land use and clutter data in our propagation models 
(with use of the Terrain Module). 
These and other features allow you to refine and expand simple scenarios into 
large and accurate representations of sharing scenarios. 
The key point is that it is simple to learn the basic operation of the software and 
simple models for the basis of much more complex ones.  
This is true of general modelling and analysis (described in the next section) as 
it is of communications and interference modelling. 
1.1.3 
Visualyse as a General System Analysis Tool 
The flexibility and basic design of Visualyse means that it can be used for many 
purposes other than interference analysis. All the variables contained in the 
simulation are open to the user and can be charted and exported for further 
processing.  
You can collect statistics on any variable in the simulation – a feature whose 
usefulness is unlimited. 
Some indication of the flexibility of the software can be given by the following list 
of possible use. This is in no way exhaustive. 
• 
Terrestrial network deployment and coverage analysis 
• 
Visualisation of the geometry and dynamics of complex scenarios 
• 
Antenna Beam and Footprint display 
• 
Satellite Constellation definition and analysis 
• 
Coverage and service level analysis. 
• 
End to end performance analysis of multi-hop systems 
• 
Path loss analysis 
• 
Link multipath fading analysis 
• 
Link Budget Analysis 
• 
Production of maps containing features from the ITU IDWM data 
• 
Analysis of visibility statistics for non-GSO satellite constellations 
Most probably you have bought Visualyse to do interference analysis, but as 
your experience and confidence with the tool grows; you will find many other 
ways to use it. 
1.1.4 
Visualyse Windows and View 
The structure of Visualyse is referred to as a “Document-View” architecture.  
Your simulation information is all contained in a Visualyse document. This is a 
file with extension .sim. A document is a simulation plus all the collected data, 
current state information and current configuration parameters. 
The information in the document can be analysed through several ‘Views’, such 
as Map views, Model View or Graph Views. Multiple views of multiple 
User Guide 
 
Page 11 
 
 
 
documents can be open at the same time. Each offers a different perspective on 
the same information. 
Visualyse simulations can be viewed using the following types of windows: 
• 
Flat projection Map View - this is a rectangular projection of the earth's 
surface. When a Map View is created the projection is either Plate-Carrée 
or Mercator projection. 
• 
3D View - this is a perspective projection of the Earth and surrounding 
orbits, viewed from a point in space. 
• 
Watch Window  - in the watch window, select simulation variables to watch 
as they evolve. The variable is presented in textual form. 
• 
Model View - the Model View shows a hierarchical view of the simulation 
elements. You can create, edit, save and load objects from this view. 
• 
Data vs. Time graph - this is a graph of any variable in the simulation 
against simulation time, updated interactively. 
• 
Distribution chart - this view is used to show probability distributions and 
cumulative distributions calculated during a simulation.  
• 
Data vs. Data graph - this allows any two Visualyse variables to be plotted 
against each other on a scatter plot. 
• 
Frequency View – this shows graphically the relative centre frequencies of 
the wanted and a selected interfering link together with the interferer’s 
transmit spectrum mask and victim’s receive filter 
If you have the Visualyse Terrain Module, there is also the: 
• 
Path profile view that will show the terrain spot heights along any chosen 
great circle path. 
All views can be configured: if you right mouse clicking in the view, outside the 
active plot area, it will bring up the properties dialog. This is equivalent to 
selecting Configure from the View menu.  
1.1.4.1 Map and 3D Views 
The flat projection map and 3D windows provide animated views of the 
simulation geometry and connectivity i.e. where the Stations are, where they are 
going and which Stations are connected together. These views can also be used 
to plot antenna coverage, colour coded or contoured area analysis and to 
display overlays on top of a simulation. 
As a snapshot of the scenario you are simulating for a report or for your own 
verification purposes, these views are invaluable. 
1.1.4.2 Watch Window 
The watch window is a way of monitoring the evolution of selected simulation 
variables. 
Select and order a list of variables and watch as they are interactively updated 
as the simulation runs. 
The data in the watch window can be copied at any time using the copy button 
at the top right. The copied data can be pasted into other applications (for 
example Microsoft Word or Excel) in a tab delimited form. 
User Guide 
 
Page 12 
 
 
 
1.1.4.3 Model View Window 
The Model View shows the structure of a simulation in a hierarchical 
arrangement of objects and their parameters. Simulation objects can be added, 
edited, duplicated, deleted, loaded and saved from this view. 
Save and Load options allow you to save and object and it’s parameters to a 
text file. This allows you to edit the object externally and reload with new data.  
1.1.4.4 Graph Windows 
There are three kinds of Graph Windows allowing variables and statistics to be 
plotted. The three graph types are: 
• 
Data vs. Time graph 
• 
Data vs. Data graph 
• 
Distribution charts 
Data vs. Time graphs allow an interactive monitor to be placed on any 
simulation variable. Interference levels and event profiles can be obtained using 
a Data vs. Time graph. 
Data vs. Data graphs are scatter plots, whose axes can be any two variables in 
the simulation. An example use of a Data vs. Data is to plot the azimuth and the 
elevation of an antenna on the same plot. 
Distribution charts are used to plot histograms and cumulative distribution 
functions. These plots can only be used for those variables that you have asked 
Visualyse to collect statistics on. In the default configuration, Visualyse collects 
no statistics until asked. 
All three types of graph are produced using software provided by Graphics 
Server. Many configuration options are provided via the Graph Control, which is 
described in detail in the section 5.2.2.5. 
1.1.5 
How to Create and Change Things in Visualyse 
Objects are created and changed in Visualyse via dialogs. Each dialog consists 
of a number of sheets (or tabs) via which the relevant parameters are entered.  
There are a number of ways to access the dialogs: 
Via the toolbar – for example, clicking the Station icon will bring up the Station 
List. This shows all the Stations in the current simulation, and gives options to 
Add, Edit, Duplicate and Delete.  
Via the menus – element lists can all be accessed from the Model menu. 
Via the Model window – you can create new elements by clicking on the “Add” 
button. Editing can be achieved by double clicking or right clicking a particular 
object.  
1.1.6 
Add, Edit, Duplicate and Delete 
For inputting and editing system data, you will work with Visualyse object lists. 
So, for example, when you click the Station icon, you will be presented with the 
station list: 
User Guide 
 
Page 13 
 
 
 
 
The Station List 
Note at the bottom of the list the four functions ‘Add’, ‘Edit’, ‘Duplicate’ and 
‘Delete’. 
These are common to all the list dialogs and are used for management of the list  
1.1.7 
The Example Files 
Visualyse is installed with a number of pre-configured example files. The 
example files cover many areas and can provide you with a quick start in the 
use of Visualyse.  
A separate document is available explaining each example file in turn. This 
document can accessed from the Help menu.

Overview of Visualyse Professional 
This section describes the way the structure of Visualyse relates to real world 
radiocommunications systems, their operation and their compatibility.  
Before we discuss the ways in which systems can be built, we need to say a few 
words about the settings that define the environment in which the systems will 
operate (chiefly which propagation models you want to use) and settings that tell 
Visualyse what outputs you are interested in.  
These should be considered before you start to model your systems, but can be 
changed at any point before you start to run the simulation. The purpose of the 
discussion below is to make you aware of the options that are available. 
2.1 
Propagation Modelling 
The Propagation menu determines the global default settings for the 
propagation environments.  
As Visualyse allows you to look at compatibility between fundamentally different 
types of system, there are often times when one single set of models cannot be 
applied to all links in simulation. An example here is where terrestrial networks 
are sharing with space networks. 
To allow maximum flexibility Visualyse classifies all links and allows you to 
select different propagation environments for each type. We have defined a five 
link types for you, but also allow you to add any number of custom types. 
For each Link type select the propagation models to be used and define the 
default parameters for those models.  
Also, you can select different models to use when the Link is a victim and when 
it is an interferer. The reason for this is founded in the philosophy of ITU-R 
Recommendations. Propagation models used for link design and coverage are 
quite distinct from those used to calculate the level of an interfering signal. 
Propagation options are defined from the Propagation menu. From this menu 
select a Link type from: 
• 
Terrestrial Fixed 
• 
Terrestrial Mobile 
• 
Space to Earth (= Earth to Space) 
• 
Space to Space 
• 
Broadcasting 
• 
Advanced 
 You can select models from the following list: 
User Guide 
 
Page 15 
 
 
 
 
Visualyse Propagation Models 
You can select any combination of models: Visualyse will warn you if there are 
any unusual combinations (e.g. multiple basic path loss) but will not stop you 
from using them.  
More information about the scope and usage of each propagation model is given 
in the Technical Annex. 
2.2 
What to Calculate and how to Collect Statistics  
The Output Menu is where you tell Visualyse which types of data to collect and 
which specific parameters to write into a log file. 
Where the analysis you are performing is dynamic, data is collected in statistical 
form. At each time step or sample point the output data is recorded in a ‘bin’ of a 
histogram. Over time the histogram becomes the probability distribution for that 
data. 
User Guide 
 
Page 16 
 
 
 
Visualyse will not by default record actual values of a parameter at each time 
step – this would require enormous amounts of memory. We do, however, have 
a log file option that allows you to select parameters for logging. 
This is useful for post-processing and validation – normally the output from 
Visualyse is statistical information on Link parameters. 
2.3 
Antennas, Stations, Carriers and Links  
Now we come to the main modelling elements, through which you define your 
systems and scenarios. 
The structure of the software underlying 
Visualyse is based on an object-oriented 
analysis of radiocommunications systems 
and interference analysis. The objects and 
the relationships between objects will seem 
familiar to most engineers.  
However, there may be some differences 
between the Visualyse model and your 
model of the world of radiocommunications. 
It is important that the exact structure of the 
software is understood if you are to gain 
maximum benefit from the tool. 
The following sections describe the Visualyse simulation elements at the top 
level. Each section provides examples of how these elements map on to objects 
in the real world and is intended to provide an overview of the structure of the 
software. This section does not provide a detailed description of the dialogs 
which is given in section 3 of this guide. 
The fundamental modelling elements that you will need to include in any 
interference modelling scenario are: 
• 
Antennas 
• 
Carriers 
• 
Stations 
• 
Links  
• 
Interference Paths 
Other elements are: 
• 
Tracking Strategies 
• 
Station Groups 
• 
Link Groups 
2.3.1 
Antennas  
Antenna performance has a significant impact on wanted signal levels and on 
interference levels. Antenna gain is directional and Visualyse allows you to 
model this directivity in 3-dimensions in a number of ways. 
To begin defining a communications system we start by defining the 
performance of the Antennas that we will use in the modelling. You create and 
There may be slight differences 
between the Visualyse abstract model 
of the world of radiocommunications 
and your understanding.  
To gain maximum benefit from the tool 
it is important that you understand the 
relationship between the various 
Visualyse elements. This may require 
some study of the text in this Guide 
User Guide 
 
Page 17 
 
 
 
edit antennas either from the Model menu or by clicking the Antenna icon on 
the Toolbar. The Antenna List will appear.  
The figure below shows an Antenna List when three Antennas have been 
created – by default the List will be empty. 
 
Figure 1 – The Visualyse Antenna List 
There are several types of Antenna in Visualyse: 
• 
Single beam antennas 
• 
Multiple beam antennas (with many different beams) 
• 
Multiple beam antennas (with many identical beams) 
• 
Spot Beam Pattern Antennas – with spot beams arranged in symmetric 
patterns 
• 
Satellite PFD mask beams – gain is calculated to provide a given PFD level 
at defined elevation angles. 
Within each type there are several ways to describe the beams used: 
• 
Circular – defined by data or gain mask 
• 
Elliptical – defined by data or gain mask 
• 
Shaped – defined by data 
• 
Contour – defined by iso-gain contours 
Visualyse includes over 80 predefined masks that cover ITU Recommendations, 
Radio Regulations, ETSI Standards and many other popular masks. Full details 
are given in the Technical Annex. You can also define roll-off in a look up table. 
User Guide 
 
Page 18 
 
 
 
If your antenna is shaped, you can define a table of gain in two dimensions 
(antenna pointing angles) or can use GIMS contours. Visualyse provides a 
simple facility to create and edit GIMS contours. 
2.3.2 
Stations  
The role of Stations is to define the geometry and dynamics of the analysis – 
where are the transmitters and receivers and where will they be in the future. 
Stations also contain Antenna objects and points the Antennas according to one 
of a selection of pointing methods. 
When you create a new Station you are given the option to select from the 
following types: 
• 
Earth 
• 
Terrestrial Fixed 
• 
Mobile 
• 
Maritime 
• 
Aeronautical 
• 
Geostationary Satellite 
• 
Non-geostationary satellite 
Visualyse internally distinguishes Station Types by the information you need to 
provide in order to define their dynamics. 
2.3.3 
Carriers  
Carriers are used to define the bandwidth and polarisation parameters to be 
used in the Links. The carrier dialog is also where you can define spectrum 
masks that can be used in calculating adjacent channel and out of band 
interference levels. 
For basic calculations the carrier defines the bandwidth. Later, when you set up 
the interference calculation, you will tell Visualyse what to do when the 
bandwidths of wanted and interfering carrier are different – this bandwidth 
overlap option can have a significant effect on results. 
It is also important to bear in mind that you will be entering power levels later 
and that you may already have entered the antenna gain for the link that this 
carrier will use – those three parameters together determine the Power Spectral 
Density. 
If you want to consider out of band or adjacent channel then this is the place 
where you will define the out of band mask.  
2.3.4 
Links  
Links define how the stations are connected together. There are four types of 
Link in Visualyse: 
• 
Fixed Links 
• 
Transmit Links 
• 
Receive Links 
User Guide 
 
Page 19 
 
 
 
• 
Dynamic Links 
Examples of the different Link types available in Visualyse are given in the 
following figures. 
 
Fixed Link Examples 
The figure above shows a satellite to ground station link and a terrestrial 
microwave link. Both these would be modelled as Fixed Links in Visualyse. 
 
Dynamic Link Example 
The figure above illustrates the movement of a vehicle through the cells of a 
mobile phone system. In this case the signal is handed over from base station to 
base station as the car moves. This would be modelled as a Dynamic Link in 
Visualyse. 
 
Dynamic Link Example 
The figure above illustrates the handover from one satellite to another as the 
first satellite falls below the horizon. This would also be modelled as a Dynamic 
Link. 
User Guide 
 
Page 20 
 
 
 
 
Receive Link Examples 
The figure above illustrates two examples that would be modelled as Receive 
Links in Visualyse.  
The first represents an earth observation satellite. The second is a scanning 
radar dish. In both cases, there is no defined wanted transmitter, and the wanted 
signal level has a known value or is unused. These links could be used to gather 
information about interference levels, when the wanted signal level is either 
known or is not relevant. 
 
Transmit Link Examples 
This figure shows two examples of transmit links. The first is a constellation of 
non-GSO satellites; the second is a terrestrial broadcast station. In cases where 
these are considered as interferers only, they would be modelled as Transmit 
Links in Visualyse. 
Station 1
Station 2
Station 3
Station Group
 
Example Scenario 
The final figure illustrates an example scenario in which a number of wanted 
Links of different types have been defined from Stations with multiple Antennas.

2.3.5 
Station and Link Groups 
You may find that a Visualyse simulation can become very large very quickly. 
This is especially true if you are working with constellations of satellites or large 
groups of terrestrial links. 
Visualyse provides a way to simplify the management of large simulations in the 
form of Link Groups and Station Groups. 
Groups can act as simple containers for stations and links – so that all your 
victim links are in one group and all your interferers in another, for example – or 
can represent real world groupings such as satellite constellations or fixed 
service chains. 
Visualyse includes ‘Wizards’ to help in the creation of some groups, making the 
production of complex scenarios much easier. 
Full details are given in the Simulation Elements section of the User Guides. 
2.3.6 
Tracking Strategies 
Tracking Strategies define the criteria for selecting a tracked station from a 
group of candidate stations. They are used in Dynamic Links to determine the 
link end station. 
There are two types of Tracking Strategy: Predefined and User Defined.  
If you cannot find the strategy you need on the predefined list, then you can 
define your own as a series of geometric constraints on end station selection. 
2.3.7 
Interference Paths  
An Interference path specifies an interference scenario. This comprises a 
wanted link or a group of wanted links and a set of interfering links. The purpose 
of an Interference Path is to calculate the interference from the interfering links 
into the wanted links.  
2.4 
How It Fits Together 
2.4.1 
Steps in the Construction of a Visualyse Simulation 
The flexibility of Visualyse means that there is no fixed prescription for setting up 
and analysing spectrum sharing scenarios. In addition, the number of other uses 
of the tool mean that there are very many ways you can begin to use the 
software. 
A prerequisite to starting up the simulation is that have a clear idea of the results 
you are looking for and have a full description of both your wanted and 
interfering systems.  
You need to know the RF, geometric and dynamic characteristics of both 
systems, and have some understanding of how these characteristics can be 
represented in Visualyse. This understanding can be gained by reviewing the 
User Guide, or from the example files and related document provided with 
Visualyse. 
However, if you follow the prescription below you will be able to set up Visualyse 
to produce C/N+I, C/I and I/N results within a matter of hours. 
User Guide 
 
Page 22 
 
 
 
The recommended steps involved in the creation and analysis of a spectrum 
sharing scenario are listed below: 
1. Define a library of Antennas that will be used 
2. Create the Stations, using Station Groups and Wizards where appropriate 
3. Define a library of communications carriers via the Carrier dialog 
4. Set up your Propagation Environments via the Propagation menu 
5. Set up communications Links – both wanted and interfering – using Link 
Groups and Wizards where appropriate 
6. Set up Interference Paths, where wanted and interfering Links are specified 
7. Define run duration and time step size using the Time Settings option on 
the Simulation menu 
8. Set up the Output you are interested in via the Output menu 
9. Run the simulation 
10. Analyse the results via the graphs, watch and table windows, and the 
various map views. 
2.4.2 
Location of Key Parameters 
In the calculation of C, I, N, C/I, C/N, C/(N+I) and I/N there are a number of key 
parameters that are defined by your input data. In Visualyse it is sometimes 
possible to define these parameters in more than one place – this ensures that 
the software remains more flexible without becoming overly complex. It does, 
however, sometimes lead to confusion in new users because not every 
parameter in every dialog is used in the interference calculation.  
This section describes where the basic link budgets parameters are or can be 
defined, and the configuration options under which the parameter will be used. 
Wanted and interfering Links are defined in exactly the same way 
Parameter  
Where Defined 
Transmit Antenna Gain 
The antenna gain is a combination of the peak gain 
plus the relative gain in the direction of interest. Both 
of these are defined in an Antenna object.  
Transmit EIRP 
The usual way to define the Link EIRP as a 
combination of Link power plus Antenna peak gain1 
Path Loss 
The path loss depends on the propagation model 
selected and the environmental parameters, defined 
via the propagation menu.  
Link Power 
Power is defined in the Link dialog.  
Spectral Density 
By a combination of Link power and the bandwidth of 
the carrier used by the Link. 
 
1A second is using the default values associated with the Antenna. The Link dialog has options to select either 
the default Antenna value or the Link power.  
User Guide 
 
Page 23 
 
 
 
Parameter  
Where Defined 
Carrier Bandwidth 
The bandwidth is defined in the edit Carrier dialog. 
There are two values, the occupied bandwidth and the 
allocated bandwidth. 
Bandwidth Overlap 
Factors 
The calculation of the C/I ratio can be done in number 
of ways as defined in the Interference Path. 
Central Frequency 
The central frequency is defined in the Link dialog.  
In the Interference Paths dialog, it is possible to force 
the wanted and interfering carriers to be co-frequency. 
This has the effect of shifting the interfering carrier to 
be on the same central frequency as wanted carrier.  
Frequency overlap 
The frequency overlap is calculated automatically 
based on the wanted and interfering carrier central 
frequencies and bandwidth. 
Wanted (or victim) Links 
The wanted Link is selected in the Interference Path 
dialog. A Link can be selected in multiple Interference 
Paths. Interference levels on a Link will be aggregate 
values due to all Interfering Links on all Interference 
Paths. 
Interfering Links 
The interfering Links are selected in the Interference 
Path Dialog 
Polarisation Advantage 
Polarisation advantage is defined in the Interference 
Path dialog. 
2.5 
The Tools Menu 
The 'Tools' menu provides access to tools and utilities that allow relationships 
between many parameters to be calculated and checked. 
The equations used by all the tools are described in the Technical Annex. 
2.5.1 
VisTools 
The Tools menu option “Launch VisTools” will start the link budget and radio 
engineering calculator as shown in the figure below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 24 
 
 
 
 
VisTools Interface 
2.5.2 
Solve for and Optimise 
Visualyse provides two tools for performing “what if…” analysis: 
The Solve For is used to find the value of a parameter that gives the wanted 
value for a second parameter.  
The Optimize is used to minimize or maximize a parameter, subject to the 
variation of a second parameter. 
2.5.2.1 Solve For 
The Solver can be used to change the value of an object attribute that is 
dependent on another object attribute. Ordinarily, the only way to change an 
attribute of this kind is to keep changing the attribute on which it depends until 
you achieve the desired result. The Solver takes over this trial and error process 
and does all the hard work for you. 
For example, say you had an Earth station communicating with a geostationary 
satellite. Your problem might be that the satellite should be positioned such that 
the relative gain at the Earth Station is 2 degrees down from main beam.  
You can use the Solver to find the longitude position for the satellite which 
achieves the requirements for relative gain at the Earth station. 
2.5.2.2 Optimize 
The Optimizer is used to maximize or minimize the value of an object attribute 
that is dependent on another object attribute. 
For example, say you had an FS network, and want to create a new hop. What 
frequency should you use? 
User Guide 
 
Page 25 
 
 
 
The Optimiser can assist you by finding a frequency that minimises interference 
from all the other FS links. 
2.6 
General User Interface Features 
2.6.1 
Right Mouse Button Functions 
Right mouse clicking can be used to perform many operations in Visualyse. For 
example: 
• 
Right clicking in the Map, 3D, and Graph views brings up menu options that 
allows you to change the display properties for the view. 
• 
Right clicking on a Station Icon gives you the option to duplicate or delete 
the station or to invoke the edit Station dialog. 
2.6.2 
Double Click Functions 
Double clicking on a station invokes the edit dialog allowing you to change the 
properties of the station. 
Double clicking on objects that appear in lists opens the object for editing 
2.6.3 
Drag and Drop 
Station drag and drop is available in the map views if you active the station 
move icon: 
 
Select Mode Icon 
For earth stations and aeronautical stations this allows the latitude and longitude 
of the station to be changed by clicking on the Station and dragging it to a new 
position.  
Geostationary satellites can be moved along the geostationary arc only.  
Dragging and dropping a non-GSO satellite will move the satellite along a fixed 
latitude by changing the ascending node of its orbit. 
2.6.4 
Common Dialog Features  
Most dialog boxes include the following buttons: 
OK - clicking this button confirms and implements any changes you have made 
then closes the dialog box. 
Cancel – clicking this button closes the dialog box without saving the changes 
you have made. 
Apply–saves the changes you have made without closing the dialog box. 
Note you do not need to click “Apply” before clicking OK. 
User Guide

2.6.5 
Dynamic Lists 
As new elements are added to a simulation, they will appear on a list that is 
accessible via the dialog appropriate to that element. If an element is removed it 
will disappear from the list.  
These lists are referred to as dynamic lists. The use of dynamic lists means that 
Visualyse places no limits on the number of Stations and other elements that 
can be defined in a simulation. 
Double clicking list items will generally invoke the edit dialog for that item. 
2.6.6 
Naming of Visualyse Elements 
Element names must be unique on each list as it is used to identify that object. 
Hence, for example, as all Stations appear on the Station list, they must all have 
unique names.  
2.6.7 
Error Messages 
Visualyse produces error messages whenever an input error occurs. The 
message consists of three boxes showing: 
• 
the problem 
• 
a description of the error 
• 
a suggestion as to how to carry on 
2.7

Creating and Editing Simulation Objects 
This section of the User Guide provides a complete reference to creating and 
editing Visualyse objects using the simulation dialogs. 
In order to benefit from this section you should already be familiar with the 
bigger picture of the way Visualyse works. 
This familiarity can be gained by reading the Overview in Section 2 of the User 
Guide, by examining the example files and associated documentation or by 
simply experimenting with the software. 
The sections below guide you through each dialog, explaining how to enter the 
data needed to define your system components, your environmental data, and 
how to tell Visualyse what to calculate for you. 
3.1 
Antenna Modelling 
The Antenna object is fundamental element in Visualyse. In encapsulates the on 
and off axis performance of antennas in isolation. An Antenna object can then 
be attached to multiple Stations where the pointing and tracking options are 
defined. 
So, to begin defining a communications system we now start by defining 
Antennas – either from the Model menu or by clicking the Antenna icon on the 
Toolbar. The Antenna list will appear.  
The figure below shows an Antenna List as it would appear when three 
Antennas have been created – by default the List will show a single omni-
directional, zero gain antenna. 
 
The Visualyse Antenna List 
User Guide 
 
Page 29 
 
 
 
The Antenna list dialog has an integrated roll-off plot in either Polar or Cartesian 
coordinates to show the variation in gain against off-axis angle for the selected 
Antenna.  
To create a new Antenna, click the Add button. The Antenna types dialog will be 
displayed. 
 
Antenna Types Dialog 
You then select from one of the five antenna types, by clicking the icon on the 
left of the list. The five types are: 
1. Single beam antenna – this is the simplest choice, the Antenna has a 
single beam. The beam can be circular, elliptical or shaped. 
2. Multiple beams – the most flexible option. The Antenna can have multiple 
beams with different characteristics. The pointing angles of the different 
beam boresights are defined individually in terms of azimuth and elevation 
relative to the antenna mechanical boresight. 
3. Multiple Identical Beams – this option is used where an antenna has 
multiple beams with identical performance characteristics but different point 
directions. 
4. Symmetric Spot Beam Pattern – use this option where the beams in a 
multiple spot are deployed with circular, hexagonal or square symmetries. 
5. Satellite PFD Mask – where the antenna performance is constrained by 
regulatory PFD limits, use this option to define those limits in terms of 
elevation angle on the ground.  
User Guide

We recommend that you read Section 3.1.1 to familiarise yourself with the 
process of creating antennas. The other subsections below, give additional 
information needed to define the more complex antennas. 
3.1.1 
Creation of a Single Beam Antenna 
In this section, you will be guided through the process of creating an Antenna 
with a single beam. The Beam may be circular, elliptical or shaped in cross-
section. 
Begin by selecting Antenna from the Model Menu 
Select the Single Beam option and click Ok. The Antenna properties dialog will 
be displayed. 
 
Antenna Properties Dialog 
Antenna Name 
The name of the Antenna (defaults to Antenna Type) is shown in bold in the top 
left-hand corner of the dialog. When the mouse passes over the name, the 
cursor also changes to a ‘caret’   
 
 
Before Mouse Over 
If you click on the name, it changes to an edit box so that you can enter a name 
for your Antenna. This is shown below. 
 
After Clicked 
User Guide 
 
Page 31 
 
 
 
There are four options under Single Beam, each relating to how the cross-
section of the beam will be specified. The choice made determines what other 
parameters are needed to fully define the Antenna. 
Each of the input parameter options is now explained in turn. 
3.1.1.1 Beam Cross-section 
The beam can be circular, elliptical or irregular shaped in cross section. 
The beam shape is selected at the top of the beam tab. As you switch between 
the options the parameters below the will change. 
 
Circular Option Selected 
 
Shaped Option Selected 
3.1.1.2 Circular and Elliptical Beams 
For circular and elliptical beams, the gain pattern is defined by the roll-off mask 
and a few Antenna parameters. 
3.1.1.2.1 Roll-Off 
To change the way the roll-off is defined, choose the Change button next to the 
roll-off field. 
 
Changing Antenna Roll-off 
The Roll-off dialog is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 32 
 
 
 
 
Antenna Roll-off Dialog 
The dialog provides two options. You can use either: 
• 
a standard equation as a mask, or  
• 
a table of gain/off-axis angle pairs  
Roll-Off Masks 
Visualyse already includes 80 or so standard roll-off masks. These are 
described in detail in the Technical Annex 
Gain Tables 
The gain table option allows you to enter the complete roll-off as a set of gain, 
angle pairs. To help with data entry, you can now copy and paste data to and 
from different sources, including from Excel spreadsheets. 
In this case is no need for you to supply other Antenna parameters such as peak 
gain and beamwidth. This will be indicated as in the dialog – under Antenna 
parameters it will say ‘determined by the gain table’. 
If the beam shape is elliptical, text will appear above the gain table to indicate 
that the gain along the semi-major axis is required. In both the circular and 
elliptical cases, the beam width (as derived from the table) is displayed. 
User Guide 
 
Page 33 
 
 
 
 
Gain Table for Elliptical Beams 
3.1.1.2.2 Antenna Parameters 
There are four parameters that are commonly used in defining Antenna 
characteristics. The four are related in standard Antenna theory and no more 
than two are ever needed to fully define an Antenna.  
As an engineer you may know your Antenna diameter but not its beamwidth, or 
vice-versa. Alternatively, you could be working to a standard antenna and know 
only the D/ 
The ‘Antenna parameters drop-down allows you to say which characteristics of 
the Antenna you know. 
Depending on the option selected, a number of applicable fields will appear. You 
can then fill in these fields with the appropriate information. 
For circular beams the combinations are as follows: 
• 
Dish Size & Efficiency 
• 
Full Beamwidth & Peak Gain 
• 
Footprint Diameter 
For elliptical beams the antenna must be defined by peak gain and the two 
beamwidths. 
For the case when a gain table defines an elliptical beam, the semi-major axis is 
determined from the data you have already put into the table (or the default 
data) and therefore does not need to be entered here. You must however, give 
the minor axis, and Visualyse will then scale the roll-off in all directions other 
than along the major axis to give the correct ellipticity.

Elliptical Beam Defined by Gain Table 
3.1.1.2.3 Beam Roll-off Preview 
A preview of the roll-off is shown to the right of the Antenna parameters. You 
can choose between polar or Cartesian plots. Each plot has its own controls that 
allow you to modify the display. 
    
 
Polar Plot 
 
 
Cartesian plot 
For both plots, you can change the slice angle by clicking and dragging the 
angle control. On the Cartesian plot, you can also zoom into areas of the graph.  
In order to understand the meaning of slice angle – if you consider and elliptical 
beam, the slice angle of the major axis is 0 or 180. The minor axis is 90 or -
90.  
These plots are provided to give you a basic idea of the shape of your Antenna 
while you are editing it. Additional plotting options are provided on the Antenna 
list dialog

3.1.1.3 Shaped Beams 
For shaped beams, a table of gain for various azimuth and elevation () angles 
replaces the roll-off and Antenna parameters. 
The dialog is shown below. The data table is shown in a scrolling window, and 
has an Edit button to the top left. 
 
Shaped Beam 
To change the table, click Edit. This opens the shaped beam properties dialog 
shown below.

You can change the size of the table from here. You can copy and paste data to 
and from the table directly from other sources, including Excel. You can also 
import from text file in various formats (see Technical Annex for more 
information). 
3.1.1.4 Contour Beams   
Visualyse allows you to create, import and edit antennas that are defined in 
terms of their gain contours in GIMS format. 
You can create and edit beams as polygons using the mouse to click on a map 
view. This allows you to define coverages from scratch or to approximate 
coverages that you only have as printed map. 
Visualyse provides facilities to import data directly from the ITU database and 
also to enter contours as polygons using the mouse. 
Visualyse then converts these to a grid of gain vs. Antenna angles and stores 
both the contours and the grid using a proprietary algorithm. In order to do this 
conversion, Visualyse needs a reference satellite longitude. This is the longitude 
of the satellite from which the contours were plotted or the longitude at which 
they will be used. If you subsequently change the longitude of the satellite using 
the Antenna, the Antenna coverage will move with the satellite. 
A new feature is that for patterns imported from GIMS, you can now select the 
GIMS algorithm for the interpolation of the gain to points in between contours – 
User Guide

which ensures compatibility with results obtained using ITU-R software. This 
option is set in Visualyse Settings (see section 4.1.1). 
The dialog is shown below. 
 
Contour Beam Shape 
Before you can enter any contours, you need to specify the longitude of the 
GSO satellite that would host the Antenna. 
Next you need to enter the limits on the gain: the peak gain and the gain floor 
(the limit of relative gain for points along way from the peak gain point). Once 
you have done this, you can go straight in and add some contours. Click Edit 
Contours. The Edit Contours dialog will appear.

From here you can set the relative gain and the exact location in latitude and 
longitude coordinates. A boresight can also be duplicated and deleted from the 
selection toolbar. 
3.1.1.4.4 Adding Contours 
To add a Closed Contour, click on the Closed Contour button 
 
1. Click to add the first point then continue clicking to add more points. You 
can also hold the mouse button and drag to draw. 
 
2. To complete the contour, click on the first point again or you can double-
click to add the last point and finish, or press ENTER. 
 
3. The completed contour is shown as the current selection. Note that you 
can cancel at any time by pressing ESC. 
 
You then need to set the relative gain for the contour. This is shown in the label 
on the contour itself. By default, it’s set to zero. To change it simply click on it 
then type in the relative gain you want and either click away or press ENTER.

To add an Open Contour, click on the Open Contour button  
 
1. Open contours must start on the field of view. When you move the 
mouse, you’ll see where the first point will be. When you click, both the 
first point and the clicked point will be added. 
 
2. Keep clicking to add more points. You can also hold the mouse button 
and drag to draw. 
 
3. Open contours must end on the field of view. When you get close the 
software will detect this. Simply click to finish. You can also double-click 
on the last point you want to add, or press ENTER, and the end point will 
be added automatically. 
 
4. The completed contour is shown as the current selection. Note that you 
can cancel at any time by pressing ESC.

3.1.1.4.5 Editing Contours 
Click on a contour to select it. Just like boresights, contours have their own 
selection toolbar. Buttons are provided to Edit Points, Reduce Points, Smooth 
Points, Switch to Open Contour, Duplicate and Delete. 
 
Editing contour points is described in the next section. 
Reducing the number of points will intelligently reduce the number of points by 
around half. Smoothing on the other hand will re-sample the contour and add 
extra points to smooth out any sharp edges. 
You can resize a contour by dragging one of the eight control points that 
surround the selection rectangle. 
 
3.1.1.4.6 Editing Contour Points 
To edit a Contour (be it Closed or Open), either double-click on it or select it and 
then press the Edit Points button on the Selection Toolbar or press ENTER.

You can click on a point and drag it to a new position. You can also use the 
cursor keys to move the selected point by small amounts up, down, left or right. 
Hold SHIFT while doing this to move the point by a larger amount each time. 
The same applies to selections containing multiple points.  
Pressing the TAB key will select the next point in the contour and SHIFT + TAB 
will select the previous point.  
To finish editing either click on the Map or another item or alternatively press 
ESC. 
3.1.1.4.6.1 Detaching from the Field of View 
As mentioned earlier, open contours should start and end on the satellite field of 
view. If you drag an open contour, then the end points will always remain on the 
field of view.  
If you want to detach the end points from the field of view, there are a couple of 
ways to do this. If you want to move the whole contour, then simply click and 
drag it but hold SHIFT as you do this. The end points will then detach. 
 
To re-attach the end points do exactly the same thing. Once an end point gets 
close to the Field of View both end points will re-attach at the nearest 
intersection. 
If you only want to move the end points then first edit the contour. Click and drag 
an end point while holding SHIFT. The point will switch between being 
unattached or detached. Note that reattaching will only happen when you drag 
close to the field of view.

3.1.1.4.7 Warnings and Errors 
You may notice that as you start to construct your shaped beam an orange 
panel will appear in the bottom-right corner of the application window. This 
shows any warnings or errors. These are mostly advisory so that you can check 
your beam will conform to GIMS requirements as you go along. 
If there are no errors or warnings, you’ll see this: 
 
If there are any warnings or errors, you’ll see something like this: 
 
3.1.1.4.8 Multiple Selections 
You can select multiple contours and boresights and then move, duplicate or 
delete all of them in one go. There are two ways to do this. You can click on an 
empty area of the map and then drag out a selection rectangle. Any contours or 
boresights that are caught in the rectangle will be selected. Alternatively just 
hold SHIFT and click to add or remove items from the selection. 
 
Multiple selections have their own Selection Toolbar. If you have a combination 
of boresights and contours then you will only get options to Duplicate or Delete.   
However, if your selection only contains contours then you’ll get all the options 
that are available to you when just a single contour is selected. This allows you 
make changes like smoothing or point reduction to several contours at once. 
You can also resize the selection when it only contains contours. All contours 
will size proportionally and maintain the same relative spacing from each 
another. 
3.1.1.4.9 Copy and Paste 
You can copy any selected contour or boresight, or any selected combination by 
using the standard keyboard shortcut CTRL+C. To paste the copied selection 
use the standard keyboard shortcut for paste, CTRL+V.

3.1.2 
Advanced Beam Options 
3.1.2.1 For all Beams 
For most purposes, you will only need to specify the gain pattern for a beam. 
However, in some circumstances you may need to specify default EIRP, 
frequency, noise and polarisation – this will depend on choices made in defining 
your Links and in most modelling situations, these parameters are specified 
directly in the Link and the Antenna parameters are ignored.  
Example applications of Antenna Advanced parameters are for: 
• 
Frequency re-use in multiple beam antennas 
• 
To plot antenna footprints where no Link has been defined and a default 
frequency is needed 
• 
To model simple variation in EIRP, as a random variable between a 
maximum and minimum value. 
For traffic modelling you may need to define a maximum load parameter (see 
the Modules User Guide).  
These parameters can be entered by clicking the ‘Advanced’ button. 
 
Advanced Options 
The noise represents the temperature of the Antenna (sky noise, plus earth 
noise etc) and can be used in the Link as part of the calculation of system noise. 
It will only be used if you decide not to enter the system temperature directly into 
the Link. If you specify this parameter and intend to use it, you must also enter 
the feeder loss (in the Station dialog) and the receiver noise figure (in the Link). 
If you intend to specify the system noise temperature for your Link, then you 
don’t need to bother with Antenna temperature. 
Note that the traffic modelling options will not be displayed unless the traffic 
module is enabled. 
User Guide 
 
Page 46 
 
 
 
3.1.2.2 Shaped Beams 
For shaped beams, there is another set of advanced options.  
These allow you to add additional gain tables depending on the angle from the 
sub-satellite point. This allows you to model adaptive Antennas (sticky beams) 
using data derived from detailed models of the Antenna. 
The options appear below the options described above. 
 
Additional Table Options 
To add another table, check one of the boxes (you can have up to six). Type the 
angle from the sub-satellite point in the box provided then click “Edit” to 
configure the table. Edit buttons only appear for selected tables. 
3.1.2.3 Contour Beams  
There are additional parameters for contour beams which are shown under 
‘Interpolation Options’.  
The software calculates the gain from contours beams by interpolation. You can 
change the way in which the interpolation is performed by clicking the Advanced 
button. 
User Guide

Contour Beams Advanced Options Dialog 
You can change the calculation method and the way in which multiple 
boresights are weighted in this process. 
3.1.2.4 IMT-Model Non-Co-Frequency Parameters 
There are additional parameters under the advanced beam options dialog when 
using one of the IMT-Models gain patterns. These allow the gain pattern to be 
different between co-frequency and non-co-frequency scenarios. 
 
User Guide 
 
Page 48 
 
 
 
 
IMT-Model Advanced Options 
The following options are available:  
- 
Use co-frequency pattern: the M.2101 pattern is used with D/lambda = 
0.5 for both co-frequency and non-co-frequency scenarios 
- 
Single element pattern: the M.2101 single element pattern is used if the 
victim centre frequency is non-co-frequency 
- 
Assume D/lambda = 0.46: in the M.2101 gain pattern a D/lambda of 0.46 
is used rather than 0.5 
- 
Variable D/lambda: it is assumed that at the centre frequency supplied 
the D/lambda = 0.5, and so for other frequencies the D is derived and 
fixed but the lambda varies depending upon the victim frequency 
The definition of what constitutes “co-frequency” and what “non-co-frequency” 
for the IMT-MODEL gain pattern is set via: 
- 
Centre Frequency: this is the centre frequency that the IMT-MODEL 
antenna has been tuned to 
- 
Co-Frequency Bandwidth: this is the total bandwidth that is defined as 
being co-frequency in range: 
o Minimum = CentreFrequency – CoFrequencyBandwidth./2 
o Maximum = CentreFrequency + CoFrequencyBandwidth./2 
Outside this frequency range the interference path is assumed to be non-co-
frequency. 
User Guide 
 
Page 49 
 
 
 
Note that to activate these non-co-frequency gain patterns it is necessary to 
configure the Interference Path as described in Section 3.9. 
3.1.3 
Multiple Beam Antennas 
To create an Antenna with more than one beam, you need to select either the 
Multiple Beams option or the Multiple Identical Beams option from the Antenna 
types dialog. See Section 3.1.3.2, for details of creating ‘cellular’ type antennas 
with circular, hexagonal or square symmetries in their beam patterns. 
3.1.3.1 Multiple Beams 
The properties dialog for multiple beam Antennas, where each beam can have 
different properties is shown below. 
 
Multiple Beam Antenna Properties 
The dialog has multiple tabs. Each beam has its own tab. These tabs contain 
the same set of controls as a single beam Antenna (Section 3.1.1). 
The Arrangement tab is where the layout of the multi-beam structure is 
determined – here you: 
• 
Define the azimuth and elevation of each beam relative to the antenna 
boresight,  
• 
Give the orientation of each beam 
• 
Preview the layout from three different perspectives. 
User Guide 
 
Page 50 
 
 
 
3.1.3.1.1 Managing Beams 
The beam tools, along the top right of the dialog, allow you to change the 
number of beams on your Antenna. There are buttons for adding, duplicating 
and deleting beams.  
Here is how to add a beam: 
 
Add Beam Tools 
Click the Add button: a pop-up menu will appear. There are options for selecting 
1, 2, 3, 4 or more beams.  
If you select More beams, you will be asked to say how many you want: 
 
Adding More Beams 
The new beams will appear as extra tabs on the dialog. If there is not enough 
space to display all the beams, as many beams as possible will be displayed. 
Two scroll buttons will appear allowing you to scroll through the tabs. 
User Guide

3.1.3.1.2 Arranging Beams 
The Arrangement tab allows you to organise the beams within your Antenna. By 
this we mean pointing the beams relative to the mechanical boresight of the 
Antenna. 
At the top of the arrangement tab is a table. This table allows you to set the 
pointing and the orientation for each beam. By default, all beams are pointed 
along the boresight of the Antenna. To change any of the entries in the table, 
simply click in the table and type a new value. You can paste in data if you have 
the information elsewhere. 
The example below shows three beams. Each one is pointing in a different 
direction relative to the Antenna boresight. 
There are three views – the top view (showing the azimuth of each beam), the 
side view (showing the elevation of each beam) and the boresight view (showing 
the 3dB contours of each beam viewed from the perspective of the Antenna). 
User Guide 
 
Page 52 
 
 
 
 
Example with Three Beams 
You can choose whether you want the beam labels to be displayed in the 
preview windows. If more than one beam overlaps exactly in any of the 
windows, the label of the first beam is shown followed by two dots. This 
indicates that there is more than one beam represented at that location. 
As well as entering the (azimuth, elevation) directly, you can also move the 
beam pointing by selecting a beam on one of the previews and moving it to a 
new location. 
Beams can be designated as electronically steerable. If this option is selected 
the beams will be pointed by according to the Link set up. This means that you 
won’t have to specify any pointing information on the arrangement tab. 
User Guide 
 
Page 53 
 
 
 
 
Beam 2 is Steerable 
In this example, Beam 2 is steerable and so the pointing options are replaced 
with text that indicates this. In addition, the beam no longer has a pointing 
direction in the preview windows. Instead, steerable beams are shown in the 
bottom-right corner of each preview.  
3.1.3.1.3 Modifying Beams 
When you click in the Beam Pointing table on the Arrangement tab, the 
corresponding beam name is highlighted in the table. To help with identification, 
the beam is also highlighted in the preview windows and on the beam tab. If the 
tab for the beam is not visible it is scrolled into view. 
To modify the parameters for a beam, you can either click on the beam tab or 
you can double click on the beam in one of the preview windows. If you use the 
double-click option and the beam tab is not visible, it will be scrolled into view 
and selected. 
User Guide

Beam3 Selected 
Editing of individual beam properties is exactly the same as for single beam 
Antennas. However, because this is a multiple beam Antenna, the individual 
beams can be duplicated and deleted. 
3.1.3.1.4 Duplicating and Deleting Beams 
When a beam has been selected, the duplicate and delete beam buttons 
become available. To duplicate a beam, click duplicate. A new copy of the beam 
will be created. The copy will become the selected beam. To create multiple 
copies, simply keep pressing the duplicate button until the desired number of 
beams has been created. 
To delete the selected beam, click Delete.  
3.1.3.2 Multiple Identical Beams 
The Multiple Identical Beams option differs from the Multiple Beams option in 
that however many beams you create, there will be only one Beams parameter 
tab and this will be applied to all the beams.

3.1.4 
Symmetric Spot Beam Pattern 
Many popular satellite systems designs include multiple spot beams, arranged in 
symmetric patterns around the Antenna boresight. The regular arrangement of 
beams with circular, hexagonal or square symmetry is used to provide cellular 
coverage on the ground. 
These can be created using the symmetric spot beam pattern antenna, as in the 
figure below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 56 
 
 
 
 
Spot Beam Pattern Antenna 
Note that you will have to change the beam type from isotropic / omnidirectional 
to see the beams as circles. 
This dialog allows complex arrangements of beams to be created using the 
various controls. After the standard field for the antenna name, the dialog is split 
into the following sections: 
• 
Pattern 
• 
Orientation of beams 
• 
Configuration of beam layout 
• 
Definition of beam(s) 
Starting with the pattern, a number of configurations can be defined, including 
circular, hexagonal (either orientation) or square (with or without central beam). 
Some examples are shown below. 
 
 
 
User Guide 
 
Page 57 
 
 
 
Circular Pattern 
Hexagonal Pattern 
Square Pattern 
If all the beams are circular, then it doesn’t matter how they are orientated. 
However, if they are elliptical it can make a significant difference – for example 
to maximise coverage or to reduce number of handovers between beams. 
Hence there are options to select the following three orientation options: 
 
Long Axis Towards Sub-
Satellite Point 
 
Short Axis Towards Sub-
Satellite point 
 
Long Axis Aligned with 
Velocity Vector 
A check box control on the dialog allows the orientation axis to be shown or 
hidden. 
There are then controls to define the number and spacing of beams with the 
pattern, as in the figures below: 
 
Hexagonal Pattern with 2 
Rings of Spots 
 
Hexagonal Pattern with 3 
Rings of Spots 
 
Hexagonal Pattern with 4 
Rings of Spots 
If you are using a hexagonal pattern to cover the field of view from a non-GSO 
satellite the outer beams are often not required as they would point towards 
space rather than intersect the Earth. Hence there is a trim or clip option to cut 
the outer beams at a specified angle, as in the examples below. 
 
5 Ring Hexagonal Pattern without Clip 
 
5 Ring Hexagonal Pattern with Clip 
User Guide 
 
Page 58 
 
 
 
All the beams can use the same pattern, as in the examples above. If you want 
different beams to use different patterns, then you can create a set of beam 
types that can be assigned to each beam. To increment the number of beam 
types that can be used and to edit each one, use these controls: 
 
Controls to Add and Edit Beam Types 
These beam types can be assigned by clicking on one of the numbers to select 
it and then on each of the beams on the preview. This can be used (for 
example) to create frequency re-use patterns, as in the figure below. 
 
Example of 4-fold Spot Beam Re-Use 
3.1.5 
Satellite PFD Mask 
Visualyse can create a special type of Antenna that will reproduce the 
constraints of an elevation dependent PFD mask. To create a satellite PFD 
mask, select Satellite PFD mask from the Antenna types dialog: this will open 
the Antenna properties for the new PFD mask. 
 
PFD Mask Antenna Properties 
Satellite PFD masks are specified as arrays of maximum allowable PFD at 
defined elevation angles.

Note the prompts as to how to use the PFD mask e.g. that the reference 
bandwidth will be defined when this Antenna is associated with a Link via its 
Carrier. 
3.2 
Stations 
Stations define the locations of your transmitters and receivers. They also define 
the dynamics i.e. how the scenario will evolve.  
The Station object includes, by reference, one or more Antennas which the 
Station points using one of the eight pointing options.  
Stations are an essential part of the definition of the geometry of a scenario. 
Later we will see how this geometry is completed and the topology defined by 
the addition of Link objects. 
The next section shows how to create and modify stations.

Station Types in Visualyse  
Visualyse Professional has seven station types:  
• 
Earth Station  
• 
Terrestrial Fixed Station  
• 
Mobile Station  
• 
Maritime Station  
• 
Aeronautical Station  
• 
GSO Satellite  
• 
Non-GSO Satellite 
The difference between the various types relates to fundamental difference in 
their dynamics – e.g. terrestrial fixed stations are constrained to move with a 
fixed point on the earth’s surface, GSO satellite have a fixed longitude in the 
geostationary orbit etc.  
Logically there is no distinction between an Earth Station (commonly taken to be 
a satellite earth station) and a terrestrial fixed station – in fact some investigation 
User Guide 
 
Page 62 
 
 
 
will show that the only difference between the dialogs is in the default icon that is 
used. 
It is recommended that you read Sections 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2, which give 
information relevant to all station types.  
The other subsections below give information specific to the station type you 
may wish to model. 
3.2.2.1 Antenna and Beam Pointing 
Common to all Station types is a selection of the method used to point the 
antennas.  
Antennas can point in one of eight ways: 
• 
Fixed pointing direction 
• 
Point at another Station 
• 
Rotate in the azimuth plane 
• 
Scan between two azimuths 
• 
Allow the Link to set pointing 
• 
Point at another Station OR the common volume 
• 
Track a station with fixed elevation 
• 
Point at another station using random offsets 
• 
Elevation by latitude 
In addition, electronically steerable beams can have their pointing angles 
changed by Links. 
These options are described below. 
Note that all Antennas have their own position and velocity vectors based upon 
the position and velocity vectors of the containing Station, with offset for 
Antenna height if required. 
Fixed Pointing Direction 
In this case the user specifies the (azimuth, elevation), and these values are 
fixed for the duration of the run for the relevant beam or Antenna. 
Point at Another Station 
Fixed on Station can take one of the following as it’s tracking target as: 
• 
Fixed upon a target Station 
• 
Fixed upon a target Antenna 
In each case at each time step the pointing angles of the Antenna are set up 
using the vector position and velocity of this Antenna and the vector position and 
velocity of the target Station/Antenna. 
Rotate in the Azimuth Plane 
Scanning Antennas have the following parameters defined: 
• 
Elevation angle 
• 
Start azimuth 
User Guide 
 
Page 63 
 
 
 
• 
Scan rate in degrees / second 
Scan between two azimuths 
Scanning Antennas have the following parameters defined: 
• 
Elevation angle 
• 
Start azimuth 
• 
End azimuth 
• 
Scan rate in degrees / second 
Allow the Link to Set Pointing 
These Antennas have their pointing angles updated by a Link during Link update 
if the Antenna is used, otherwise the angles are not changed. 
Point at Another Station or the Common Volume 
In this case the Antenna will point in the direction (azimuth) of the selected 
Station, but that Station is (or becomes if the Station is moving) transhorizon, will 
point at the horizon in the direction. In effect this is how a troposcatter system 
points its Antennas. 
The ‘common volume’ is indicated in the diagram below

Station B

The Common Volume 
Track a station with fixed elevation 
This option is as “Point at Another Station” but the user can enter a fixed 
elevation value that is used at every time step instead of the calculated value. 
Point at another station using random offsets 
This option is as “Point at Another Station” but the user can enter a random 
offset range for azimuth and elevation that are used at every time step instead of 
the calculated value. 
Elevation by latitude 
A table of elevation angle vs. latitude should be entered together with the 
azimuth to use. At each time step the current latitude of the station will be used 
to derive an elevation angle from the table using linear interpolation. For non-
GSO systems the coordinate reference system should be set to “North based”. 
Note on Electronically Steerable Beams 
User Guide 
 
Page 64 
 
 
 
If a beam is defined in the Antenna dialog (Section 3.1) as ‘Electronically 
Steerable’ the point angles can be defined by reference to the needs to a Link 
(Section 3.4) where the end point of a link moves, or is subject to handover, the 
point angles of the beam may change from whatever is defined in the Station. 
3.2.2.2 Fixed Terrestrial Stations 
When you create a new fixed terrestrial Station, the dialog shown below will 
appear.

If you select degrees, minutes, seconds, the format is: 
 
 
[N/S/E/W] DD:MM’SS.SS” 
You can choose whether to specify the height of your Station above the terrain 
or above sea level. If you have any terrain data in this simulation the terrain 
height at that location is displayed. 
3.2.2.2.2 Adding and Managing Antennas 
A Station can have multiple Antennas. The parameters for each Antenna are 
presented on a separate tab. By default, a Station is created with one Antenna.  
An example Antenna tab is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 66 
 
 
 
 
 
Antenna Tab 
The parameters for the selected Antenna are: 
• 
Type – which of your library of antenna models to use for this station  
• 
Feeder loss – what is the loss in dB due to the feed from the antenna to 
the receiver (not transmitter – see Technical Annex for more information) 
• 
Pointing options – how is the pointing of this antenna determined. 
Click the Select button to change the type of Antenna. This will show a dialog 
from which you can choose one of the new Antennas you have created. 
User Guide 
 
Page 67 
 
 
 
 
Choose Antenna Dialog 
Choosing an Antenna Type means that the Station will use the characteristics of 
the Antenna as defined in the Antenna list. An important point is that if the 
Antenna in the Antenna list changes, all Stations that use that Antenna will 
change accordingly.  
Antenna Pointing  
They presented as a set of radio buttons and the options are described in 
Section 3.2.2.1. Clicking the required method reveals the parameters needed to 
fully define it. 
First you decide how you want to point your Antenna, and then you set the 
required parameters for the pointing option you have chosen.  
More options 
The ‘more options’ button allows you to specify Antenna temperature and the 
Antenna height. 
Feeder temperature is needed if you are going to let Visualyse calculate system 
noise from the component contributions due to the Antenna, feeder and 
receiver. The choice of how to calculate system noise is made in the Link dialog 
(section 3.6.2) – you have the option simply to enter the system noise directly in 
Kelvins, and if you are going to do this there is no need to enter the Antenna 
noise. 
Antenna height is the height above the Station, and has some influence on 
some propagation models and, of course some influence on the simulation 
geometry.

Antenna Options 
3.2.2.2.3 Managing Multiple Antennas in a Single Station 
Management of multiple antennas is very similar to that of beams on the 
Antenna dialog (Section 3.1.3.1.1). To add multiple Antennas, click on the black 
arrow to the right of the Add Antennas button.  
 
 
User Guide 
 
Page 69 
 
 
 
Adding Antennas 
From this menu, you can choose how many Antennas you want to add to your 
Station. There are options for quickly adding up to four Antennas at a time. If 
you want more than four Antennas, click the More Antennas option. A dialog box 
will appear allowing you to specify the exact number of Antennas you require. 
 
More Antennas 
New Antennas appear as new tabs. If there are more Antennas than will fit 
across the dialog, scroll buttons will appear to allow you to access the extra 
tabs. 
Duplicating and deleting functions work on the currently selected Antenna. If you 
duplicate, the new Antenna becomes the active selection. If you delete, the next 
Antenna becomes the selection (unless you delete the last Antenna in which 
case the previous Antenna becomes the active selection) 
Naming Antennas 
Antennas are automatically given names by the software. However, you can 
give your Antennas more meaningful names, and this practise is encouraged 
because good naming makes complex models easier to understand (especially 
if you revisit them at some time in the future and need to remember what you 
were doing) 
You rename the antenna by interacting with the name on the tab directly. It 
works in the same way as when you change the Station name. 
When the mouse passes over the Antenna name the cursor changes to a caret, 
. 
If you click on the name, it changes to an edit box so that you can alter it. This is 
shown below. 
    
Typing a new name causes the tab to automatically resize. Click away or hit 
Return to finish editing. 
 
You can only do this with the selected Antenna. To change the name of another 
Antenna, you need to select it first. 
3.2.2.2.4 Advanced Options 
The advanced tab incorporates the Station coordinate system parameters and 
attitude parameters relating to the station reference frame.  
User Guide 
 
Page 70 
 
 
 
 
Advanced Station Options 
For a description of the effect of changing the coordinate system reference, and 
for definitions of the Station azimuth and elevation see the Technical Annex. 
Parameters relating to the reference frame definition and to the station attitude 
are editable here. 
Click the ‘Cartesian Vectors’ button to bring up the definitions of the vector 
position and velocity of the station.  
 
Position and Velocity 
You can edit the vector components directly here – it is unlikely that you will ever 
want to do this, and we recommend that, unless you know exactly what you are 
doing, do not change these fields. 
User Guide 
 
Page 71 
 
 
 
3.2.2.2.5 Traffic Modelling 
Traffic won’t appear on the Station dialog at all unless your installation has the 
traffic module. If traffic is enabled, the traffic tab will appear as shown below. 
 
Traffic Tab 
For details of how to use the traffic module, please refer to the Module User 
Guide. Note the maximum load field can be used by the Population Data 
processing as described in Section 3.3.2. 
3.2.2.3 Earth Stations 
These are identical to terrestrial fixed Stations in terms of functionality. The only 
difference is the dialog name and the default icon (an Earth Station). 
3.2.2.4 Mobile Stations 
Mobile Stations are the same as Terrestrial Fixed Stations except that they can 
move around. The position tab allows you to set the start location and how the 
Station moves from that start location. 
User Guide 
 
Page 72 
 
 
 
 
Mobile Station Position Tab 
Heading can be changed by typing a value in the box. The angle control next to 
the box indicates the angle that has been entered. By clicking and dragging in 
the angle control itself, you can also set the heading. 
Note here that this simple motion can be over-ridden by using the Define 
Variable module, which allows you complete control over the location of the 
station throughout a simulation. This module also allows you to vary parameters 
randomly and hence perform Monte-Carlo simulations (see the Modules User 
Guide) 
3.2.2.5 Maritime 
These are the same as mobile Stations. The only difference is the default icon (a 
ship). 
3.2.2.6 Aeronautical 
Again, identical to mobile Stations, but with the addition of a climb rate 
parameter on the Position tab. Default icon is an aircraft. 
User Guide 
 
Page 73 
 
 
 
 
Aeronautical Station Position Page 
3.2.2.7 Non-GSO Satellites 
Satellites differ from fixed and mobile Stations only by the way their position is 
specified. For non-GSO satellites, the classical orbit elements describe an 
orbital pattern that allows the position of the satellite to be calculated for any 
point in time. 
So instead of the position page on the Station dialog, for non-GSO satellites, we 
have the Orbit page. 
User Guide 
 
Page 74 
 
 
 
 
Orbit Page 
This dialog prompts you for a set of parameters that define the orbital elements 
of a satellite. 
There are two modelling options here: 
• 
Selection of the orbit model  
• 
Selection of way to define the ascending node. 
Visualyse has two orbit propagation options: 
• 
Simple central potential  
• 
Central potential plus secular perturbations due to the J2 term associated 
with asphericity of the earth.  
For technical details you can refer to the Technical Annex. 
The ascending node can be specified relative to a fixed location on the earth 
(longitude) or a fixed location in space (first point of Aries). The first option is 
called ‘Longitude of Ascending Node’ the second is ‘Right Ascension’  
Choosing right ascension now requires you to specify an epoch for the orbit. 
This is needed as the location of a satellite will change relative to the earth if the 
time at which the orbital elements were valid is different from the current 
simulation time. 
So, for example, you may have an element data from a couple of weeks ago but 
only just be ready to make your simulation. In this case you need to tell 
Visualyse the date on which the orbit data were valid (the Epoch). 
The Epoch definition is accessed via the Advanced button on this dialog 
User Guide 
 
Page 75 
 
 
 
 
Epoch Definition 
3.2.2.8 GSO Satellites 
Geostationary satellites are in orbit just like the non-GSOs. However, because 
they maintain a roughly fixed position above the earth, we don’t need to define 
them by the classical orbit elements and can specify their position in a simpler 
way. 
  
GSO Orbit Characteristics 
For most GSO work, only the longitude and inclination angle are required. For 
more advanced modelling, click the “More orbital elements” button. This will 
open the GSO orbital elements dialog. This allows you to specify the 
eccentricity, and phase in e and i. 
User Guide 
 
Page 76 
 
 
 
 
GSO orbital elements 
Phase in e (eccentricity) and Phase in i (inclination) relate to orbital anomaly 
(see the Technical Annex). Phase in e tells you how far from the apogee the 
satellite is at and Phase in i how far it is from maximum inclination – when the 
satellite was created. These parameters can have a dramatic effect on the 
ground track of satellite that is not in exactly circular orbit. 
3.3 
Station Groups 
Station Groups are introduced in Visualyse Professional to make large 
simulations more manageable and understandable. 
They also have associated ‘Wizards’ that allow for simpler creation of multiple 
identical stations based on a few parameters – for example you can make large 
constellations of identical satellites, or thousands of test point stations in defined 
service area. 
As a general tip, it is better to manage Stations through Groups rather than 
directly through the Station List. The Station List can become very large, even in 
relatively simple scenarios 
Stations in Visualyse can be collected into Groups. Stations in a Group may or 
may not be connected for interference calculation purposes. Groups can be 
used simply as aids to organising and analysing data. 
A Station can be in more than one Group at the same time. Station Groups are 
treated as sub-sets of the complete Station List. 
Visualyse Professional includes four methods for creating Station Groups, each 
of which is now briefly discussed. Detailed descriptions of each type are given in 
the subsequent sections. 
User Guide 
 
Page 77 
 
 
 
  
Selection of Station Group Type 
Station Group - Create Empty  
Empty groups can be created and Stations can be added to it from the list of all 
Stations within the simulation. Even if Stations are being created individually it 
can be useful to assign them to a Group – for example to manage simulations 
by collecting like Stations together. 
This also allows groupings of Stations that are not related in any of the ways 
assumed by the other Groups. 
For example, satellite constellations that do not have the symmetries assumed 
by the Constellation Wizard are not excluded in Visualyse. The Constellation 
Wizard can be run several times to produce single planes of satellites with 
differing orbital parameters. Then, by creating and editing an empty Group it is 
possible to put all the planes into the same group and create a new 
constellation.  
Mixed GSO/non-GSO constellations can be created in a similar way.  
Constellation Wizard 
The Constellation Wizard creates a Group of identical Stations in a non-GSO 
constellation with certain symmetry properties. Stations are assumed to orbit in 
equally spaced planes and to be equally spaced around each plane. You can 
also use the Constellation Wizard to import two-line element sets (TLEs). 
Service Area Wizard 
The Service Area Wizard creates multiple Stations in or on the boundary of a 
geographical area defined by latitude/longitude limits, or by the footprint of a 
selected antenna 
HEO Wizard 
The HEO Wizard allows you to define constellations of HEO satellites in several 
useful orbit configurations. 
User Guide 
 
Page 78 
 
 
 
Re-running the Wizards 
In certain circumstances Wizards can be re-run in order to modify the Station 
Group. You need to be aware of the knock-on effect that this can gave on the 
rest of your simulation. The first thing that re-running a Station Wizard does is 
delete the existing station in the group to be re-defined – and this results in any 
Links that use those stations becoming un-defined. You will need to fix the 
affected links. 
3.3.1 
The Constellation Wizard   
Selecting Constellation Wizard starts the wizard dialog. The Dialog consists of a 
single sheet as shown below. 
 
Constellation Wizard – Symmetric Planes 
A non-GSO constellation is defined in the wizard either by a set of parameters 
which you input directly or by pointing to a data file that contains TLEs. 
If you select Define Constellation by ‘Symmetric Planes you will need to enter 
the parameters as described below: 
• 
Number of planes of satellites 
User Guide 
 
Page 79 
 
 
 
• 
Number of satellites per plane 
• 
Orbit height (altitude) - given in kilometres above 
mean sea level 
• 
Orbit inclination - given in degrees 
• 
Angle between planes – this is difference in 
latitude between adjacent satellite planes. You 
can set this to any angle or ask Visualyse to 
space the planes evenly. 
• 
Phasing between consecutive planes – this specifies whether there is any 
relative offset in anomaly between equivalent satellites in adjacent planes 
• 
The longitude of the ascending node of the first plane (at t=0) 
• 
The offset of the first satellite in the first plane (specifies the anomaly of the 
first satellite in plane one at t= 0) 
• 
The artificial precession rate. 
The preview facility shows the sub-satellite points of all the satellites in the 
constellation and can be used to fine tune the coverage. 
For many larger constellations, the phase between satellites in different planes 
is not controlled and can be modelled as essentially random. The Constellation 
Wizard provides a facility to randomise the phase. To use this feature, select the 
‘Random’ box. To see the effect of the random phasing, click the Randomise 
button, followed by the preview button. 
To make even randomly generated results repeatable, the Randomise button 
will always use the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers. To get n 
different random phasings, click the randomise button 1, 2, 3, … n times. 
Constellations Based on Two Line Elements 
If you choose “Define Constellation by” to be “TLE File”, you will see the dialog 
below: 
Don’t forget to define 
the template satellite 
parameters, by 
pressing the ‘Satellite 
Properties’ button, top 
right of the dialog! 
User Guide 
 
Page 80 
 
 
 
 
Constellation Wizard – Import from TLE file 
To import data click the ‘Import TLE button’ and locate the text file containing the 
elements. 
You will be presented with a list of all satellites in the file, which may look 
something like the following 
User Guide 
 
Page 81 
 
 
 
 
Selection of Satellites from TLE File 
You must either select each satellite you want to import individually or click 
‘Choose all systems’. When you have made you choice, a preview will appear 
and when you are ready to go, click the Create button bottom right of the dialog.. 
Template Satellite Parameters 
As well as Constellation parameters, you will need to define the satellite 
parameters that will be used for each satellite (you define one set of parameters 
and all satellites are identical on creation).  
To define your template satellite, click on the ‘Satellite Properties’ button. This 
will bring up the non-GSO Satellite dialog. The orbit tab can be ignored, as this 
will be over-ridden by the constellation dynamics.  
Set up the Antenna for your template satellite and the Wizard will create a 
constellation of identical satellites for you. 
User Guide

3.3.2 
Service Area Wizard  
Service Area analysis, looking at detailed results over a 
wide area, can be performed by distributing test point 
Stations over an extended area and setting up Links to 
each Station. Useful information about service levels can 
then be obtained by analysing the Links to find ‘worst 
cases’ (see Link Groups Section 3.7.2 for more details).  
The Service Area Wizard has three pages. The first page 
is the Template Station page (shown below). 
 
 
Service Area Wizard Station Page 
You can set the name of the Service Area Group in the top-left of the dialog. The 
station icon can also be changed.  
The other options allow you to say which station will be replicated across the 
service area. The choices are: 
• 
To generate new stations  
• 
Use an existing Station as a template – you will then need to select the 
Station to use from the list box 
• 
Define a new template Station: pressing the Edit button allows you to 
define the new station which will be used as the template  
Having made the selection and defined your template Station, click Next to 
move on to the Service Area page. From here you can define the extent of your 
service area.  
There are five ways you can define your service area: 
• 
As a rectangular region  
A quicker, broad-brush 
picture 
of 
the 
performance over a wide 
area can be obtained by 
referring to the Area 
Analysis functions. This 
is detailed in the Data 
Analysis Volume of these 
User Guides. 
User Guide 
 
Page 83 
 
 
 
• 
By reference to a particular Beam footprint 
• 
Using a Country border derived from the IDWM database 
• 
Based on a series of discrete points defined in a text file 
• 
Using a hexagonal deployment 
Service Area Defined by Region 
If you want to define it by a rectangular region, select the Region option. This is 
the default and is shown below. 
 
Service Area Wizard - Region 
The extent of the area is shown, and you can edit the latitude and longitude of 
the corners directly at the top of the dialog. The area is also shown on the map 
as a shaded red border. You can resize and move this border to change the size 
of the service area. 
You can zoom into the map by clicking the magnifying glass. This puts you into 
zoom mode. When you pass the mouse over the map the pointer will change to 
a magnifying glass - left-click to zoom in and right-click to zoom out. You can 
move around by dragging the map as you move around on the Plate Carrée or 
Mercator views. 
When you have selected the geographic extent of your area you then need to 
decide whether to fill the area or populate its edges. If the former, then it is 
necessary to specify: 
• 
How many stations will fill it. 
• 
How will those stations be deployed. 
You must choose between three methods for defining your grid: 
User Guide 
 
Page 84 
 
 
 
1. Stations: in that case you simply say how many columns of stations there 
will be (‘North’) and how many rows (‘East’). Visualyse will create a 
rectangular grid based on this input  
2. Grid: this also creates a rectangular grid, but this time based on the 
spacing of stations N-S and E-W. 
3. Hexagon: in this case the grid is in a hexagonal not rectangular pattern, 
again based upon spacing of stations N-S and E-W. 
 
Service Area Wizard – Grid Definition 
If rather than filling the area you want to fill the perimeter you must defined the 
spacing between Stations. 
If “Get population data” is selected, then each of the Stations created will have 
their “Maximum load” field set from the population database. The population will 
be that calculated to be in a tile defined using the number of stations North/East 
or spacing in km North/East. Note that this option is not available when 
deploying stations in hexagons or with the fill the perimeter option. This requires 
the population data directory be set as in Section 4.1.2 
The preview window shows where stations will be located on a map. This is 
automatically updated whenever you change any of the parameters. 
Service Area Defined by Beam 
The second way of specifying an area is by a beam footprint. To do this, select 
the Beam Footprint option.  
Select the satellite, antenna and beam you want to use, as shown in the figure 
below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 85 
 
 
 
 
Defining the Area by a Beam Footprint   
 
Satellite Selected Showing Beam  
As with the region option, you can zoom into the map if you need to. 
When you are happy with your service area, click Next. This will take you to the 
Station Deployment page. From here you decide how stations will be arranged 
in the service area. 
User Guide 
 
Page 86 
 
 
 
 
Station Deployment Page  
There fill options are the same as for the region option described above. 
Service Area Defined by Country 
The next way of specifying an area is by using a country’s border. To do this, 
select the “Country” option and then from the drop-down list select the one of 
interest, as in the figure below: 
User Guide 
 
Page 87 
 
 
 
 
Service Area Wizard – Country 
Having done the selected country will be highlighted in the preview which you 
can configure using the standard zoom and map move options. 
If you click on next you will be able to use the standard Service Area Wizard 
controls to either populate either the country’s area or border with Stations. 
An example of the fill border options is shown in the figure below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 88 
 
 
 
 
Service Area Wizard – Deployment along Country Border 
Service Area Defined by Locations 
The next way of specifying an area is by using a text file to specify the (latitude, 
longitudes) of each station. To do this, select the “Location” option and then the 
file that contains the data, as in the figure below. 
 
Service Area Wizard – Locations 
User Guide 
 
Page 89 
 
 
 
Having selected the appropriate file you can click next, and the wizard will 
display the latitude ad longitudes read in together with a preview on a map as in 
the figure below. 
 
Service Area Wizard – Locations Preview 
Service Area Defined by Hexagons 
The final way to define the service area is through a deployment of stations in 
hexagonal pattern. To do this, select the “Hexagons” option and you will be 
prompted for the central latitude and longitude, e.g. 
User Guide 
 
Page 90 
 
 
 
 
Service Area Wizard – Hexagons 
Again, the standard map zoom and pan controls can be used. If you click on 
“Next” you can then define the hexagonal pattern to use based upon rings or 
grid, as in the figures below. 
 
Service Area Wizard – Hexagons in Circles or Rectangular Grid 
A key field to both is the separation distance between Stations. 
User Guide

3.3.3 
HEO Wizard 
The Visualyse HEO Wizard helps you define repeating ground track HEO 
constellations with varying numbers of ground track, orbit period and numbers of 
satellites per track.  
The orbits that Visualyse defines are also sometimes referred to as QuasiGEO, 
Molniya or Tundra orbits.  
Each satellite is, as usual, based on a single template station. 
The HEO Wizard Dialog is shown below: 
 
HEO Wizard Constellation Definition 
The parameters that are used to define the HEO constellation are: 
1. The period of the orbit  
2. The number of distinct ground track s 
3. The number of satellites per track  
4. The eccentricity of the orbit 
5. The orbital inclination angle  
6. The apogee location – the highest point of the orbit. The satellites move 
more slowly at higher altitude and so the apogee point is the location where 
they are often said to be QuasiGSO. For a system that will provide service 
to the Northern Hemisphere the apogee would be in the north. 
7. The longitude of the apogee of the first track – this defines the point on the 
earth above which the apogee will occur 
User Guide 
 
Page 92 
 
 
 
8. Time between satellites on adjacent track reaching their apogee. This 
parameter determines whether, in a multi-track system, satellites on 
adjacent plane are interleaved or whether they are at the same relative 
points in their orbits at the same time. 
Having defined all these parameters Visualyse will create satellites with orbital 
elements that produce a single ground track for each plane – these elements 
are consistent with the point mass orbit propagation model. 
3.3.4 
Editing Groups 
On the Model menu, select Station Groups. Select the Station Group you want 
to edit and click Edit. The Modify Group dialog (shown below) will be displayed. 
 
Modify Group Dialog 
The dialog contains two lists - the Station List and a list of Stations in the 
currently selected Group. Options from this dialog are as follows: 
• 
Add - creates a new Station 
• 
Wizard - run the wizard (for groups created by a wizard) 
• 
Include - includes a Station from the Station List on the left in the Group 
• 
Edit - edits the selected Station 
• 
Duplicate - makes a new Station which is an exact copy of the selected 
Station  
• 
Remove - removes the selected Station from the group 
• 
Delete - deletes the selected Station from the simulation 
• 
Filter – filters the Station List on the left 
User Guide 
 
Page 93 
 
 
 
3.3.5 
Re-running Station Group Wizards 
In most circumstances you can re-run a Station Wizard to modify the parameters 
of the Station Group. However, usually there are knock-on effects to other parts 
of the simulation, and you need to be aware of these. 
The first thing that the Wizard does, if you re-run it, is to delete all the Stations 
currently in the Group. If you have already included those Stations in Link 
objects, then those Link objects will be affected and will need to be repaired. 
In many cases, you will have Linked the Stations up using a Link Group Wizard 
(see Section 3.7), and you will be able to re-run the Link Group Wizard to fix up 
the Links. 
3.3.6 
Importing Station Groups  
Visualyse gives you six options under the Model Menu to import stations (and 
Links in some cases). These are: 
1. Import GSO Systems 
2. Import Non-GSO systems  
3. Import FS Systems  
4. Import Terrestrial IFIC 
5. Import Tx Systems 
6. Import Rx Systems 
7. Import Non-GSO Orbit Elements 
3.3.6.1 Importing GSO and Non-GSO Satellite Systems  
The first two options will allow you to import station information from the SRS 
database. 
You need to have a compatible installation of the SRS and the GIMS database – 
Refdb. 
To use the Import GSO facility you need to define the location of the SRS 
database.  
Clicking the Import GSO button 
 or selecting Import GSO from the Model 
Menu, opens the GSO Systems Chooser dialog – the first part of which is shown 
below. If this is the first time you have used this feature you will need to click on 
the button ‘Click here to select a data source’.  
User Guide 
 
Page 94 
 
 
 
 
Select a Data Source 
User Guide 
 
Page 95 
 
 
 
 
Populated list of GSO Systems 
Once the database is loaded, the list of available stations will be populated.  
You can apply a number of filters to the list:  
1. Filter by name  
2. Filter by frequency – show only networks with notified frequencies in the 
range specified 
3. Filter by longitude – show only networks with the specified longitude range 
4. Filter by Admin code – show only networks of a selected administration. 
The network list will be adjusted according to the filters you set, and you can 
then select the network(s) you wish to import. 
Some networks are shown in grey and some in black. Grey networks are API 
notices and have no antenna data associated. In these cases, the import will 
only give you an empty GSO Station object.  
For networks in black bold text, Visualyse will retrieve all the antenna data from 
the GIMS database and create a Station object and an Antenna object 
representing each network. 
For non-GSO systems, the process runs along similar lines. Clicking the Import 
non-GSO button 
 or selecting Import non-GSO from the Model Menu, opens 
the non-GSO Systems Chooser dialog 
User Guide 
 
Page 96 
 
 
 
 
Populated list of non-GSO Systems 
The filters are simpler because the longitude filter does not apply but you can 
filter by name and admin. 
To define your template satellite, click on the ‘Satellite Properties’ button. This 
will bring up the non-GSO Satellite dialog. The orbit tab can be ignored, as this 
will be over-ridden by the constellation dynamics.  
Set up the Antenna for your template satellite and the Wizard will create a 
constellation of identical satellites for you. 
When you import a non-GSO system you get a Station Group that represents 
the constellation in the filing. 
3.3.6.2 Import FS Systems  
You can import large numbers of fixed service microwave links using the FS 
import facility.  
Choose Import FS Systems from the Model menu to access this function of the 
software. Systems can be imported from text file. You can copy and paste data 
from other applications or enter the data directly into the software. 
User Guide

FS Import 
The figure above shows you the format required – full details are given in the 
Technical Annex.  
Once your preview data seems to be correct, click the ‘Create Systems’ button 
and Visualyse creates multiple Station and Link objects which it places in Station 
and Link Groups. 
3.3.6.3 Import from the Terrestrial IFIC  
This feature interfaces directly to any database that has the structure of the 
Terrestrial IFIC.  
Selecting the Import Terrestrial IFIC from the Model menu or clicking the 
terrestrial IFIC icon, starts up the dialog.  
User Guide 
 
Page 98 
 
 
 
 
Terrestrial IFIC Search Dialog 
As for the other Import options, the first step is to define the location of your 
database. The database can be either a single .MDB file downloaded from the 
ITU website (BR IFIC option) or the collection of database files found on the 
Terrestrial IFIC DVD (DVD option). 
Once this is defined there are number of filter options, which can be applied in 
combination: 
1. Administration - import only filings from the specified administration 
2. Receipt date - set a range of ‘receipt dates’ and only import systems filed 
within that range 
3. Location - defined a box by latitude and longitude extremes and only import 
systems within that area 
4. Filing type - import only systems of one or more given filing types 
5. Service - import only systems of one or more given service types 
Having selected the search criteria and clicked on “Search”, Visualyse 
Professional will search the Terrestrial IFIC for filings that meet the criteria. 
Note that searches with very wide criteria can take a long time to complete – it is 
recommended to use filtering where ever feasible. 
Having searched the IFIC, Visualyse Professional will count the number of 
records and display them in a dialog similar to this: 
User Guide 
 
Page 99 
 
 
 
 
Output from Search of Terrestrial IFIC 
This stage allows you to assess if the number returned is as expected – for 
example the criteria might too stringent and no systems were found or too wide 
so that thousands of systems would be imported. 
If you are happy with the results click on “Yes” and then Visualyse Professional 
will load a list of the systems that can then be selected. In addition it checks for 
duplicate filings – those that have the same parameters apart from one field that 
Visualyse Professional would not use. For example the same system could be 
filed for two different reasons, but only one record would be returned. 
This list would look something like this: 
 
Terrestrial IFIC Search Results 
Sometimes the software is unable to load a system due to missing data. Clicking 
on the “xx Failed” text shows a dialog detailing why the systems failed to load 
the system. 
 
User Guide 
 
Page 100 
 
 
 
 
You can then select all systems or a sub-set of the systems to import into 
Visualyse Professional.  
The Terrestrial IFIC import reads the database and populates the following 
objects: 
• 
Antennas 
• 
Stations 
• 
Carriers 
• 
Links 
The figure below shows an example import and the model view is open to show 
all the objects created.

Tip:  
It is worth checking the data returned as there can be fields not defined. For 
example, in this example two of the stations had antenna height of zero 
metres – only one had a valid height.

3.4 
Carriers 
This section describes how carriers are modelled and defined in Visualyse.  
Carriers are where you define bandwidths, polarisation, and other characteristics 
of the signal spectrum together with some aspects of the signal structure.  
Things which are addressed in the carrier dialog are: 
• 
Allocated bandwidth 
• 
Occupied bandwidth 
• 
Polarisation 
• 
Receive and transmit masks  
• 
Digital/analogue modulation 
• 
Is the carrier a radar carrier 
• 
Radar carrier parameters 
The edit Carrier dialog is shown in the figure below.  
User Guide 
 
Page 105 
 
 
 
 
Edit Carrier Dialog 
The dialog is made more complex by the fact that the effect of bandwidths and 
spectral masks varies depending on choices you will make later when you set 
up the interference. Put simply – you need to decide how to deal with 
interference in cases where bandwidths can be very different and also how to 
deal with the out of band emissions implied by non-trivial spectral masks. This is 
covered further in more on this in Section 3.9. 
Spectrum Masks and Net Filter Discrimination  
Version 7 introduced the TX and RX masks which together can be used to 
define a net filter discrimination (NFD). The details of the calculation are given in 
the Technical Annex, but the idea is that you define the data that represents the 
spectral mask for in band and out of band emission/response for this carrier 
when used in a transmitter or receiver. 
Data are entered in a table that gives the relative level of the mask compared to 
the peak, at any number of frequency off-sets from the centre frequency.  
Later, when you define a victim and an interferer, Visualyse will do a numerical 
convolution and work out the Net Filter Discrimination over the whole 
User Guide 
 
Page 106 
 
 
 
overlapping band. You can also get Visualyse Professional to use the bandwidth 
calculated from the transmit spectrum mask in the NFD calculations. 
The carrier type can be specified as digital or analogue – if you are modelling 
multiple hop systems and looking at end-to-end performance this will have a 
significant effect. Noise on a series of analogue links is additive, whereas on 
digital regenerating links the noise in the system is determined by the worst 
single link. 
The polarisation of the carrier can be defined as left or right circular, linear 
vertical or linear horizontal. This can be considered when calculating 
interference levels depending on choice made in setting up the Interference 
Path object (Section 3.9). 
If you have the Visualyse Traffic Module then other carrier parameters, 
accessible via the Advanced button, will also be relevant. The significance of 
these parameters and the use of different load methods are described in the 
Module User Guide. 
The radar parameters are used in the interference path to calculate the On 
Tune Rejection (OTR) according to ITU-R Rec. M.1461 “Procedures for 
determining the potential for interference between radars operating in the 
radiodetermination service and systems in other services”. 
3.5 
Propagation Modelling 
Propagation modelling in Visualyse is dealt with at simulation level. This means 
you define a global propagation environment in terms of which loss models to 
apply to different types of Link, and Visualyse does the rest. The global 
environment can be over-ridden for each link individually. 
Visualyse classifies Links into the following types: 
• 
Terrestrial fixed 
• 
Terrestrial mobile 
• 
Space  earth 
• 
Space – space 
• 
Broadcasting 
• 
User defined (as many additional ones as you need) 
For each Link type you define a set of propagation models to be applied. 
Different models to can be applied depending on whether the Link is victim or 
interferer. 
We refer to the whole set of propagation models for the different Link types as 
the Propagation Environment. 
In order the set your propagation environment begin with the Propagation menu 
(shown below). 
User Guide 
 
Page 107 
 
 
 
 
Propagation Menu 
To change the models used by a particular Link type, simply select the Link type 
from the Propagation menu. The properties dialog for the selection will be 
displayed. 
 
Link Type Propagation Options 
The dialog above shows the models that will be used for terrestrial fixed Links.  
You may wish to treat propagation in a different way when considering wanted 
and interfering signal levels – this is normal practise if you are following ITU-R 
Recommendations. In Visualyse, a Link can be used as both a victim and 
interferer. 
You can change the models used by clicking the appropriate ‘Change Models’ 
button. The Propagation models dialog will appear. 
User Guide 
 
Page 108 
 
 
 
 
Propagation Models Dialog 
You can select any combination of the base propagation models plus any rain or 
atmospheric models. Visualyse does not restrict the combinations you choose 
but will generate a warning message (which you can ignore) if you choose two 
models, each of which has a free space element included in it. This helps 
prevent double counting of free space loss. 
3.5.1 
Propagation Model Parameters 
Many of the propagation models have associated parameters. You can edit 
these by double clicking on the model or by selecting it and clicking the Model 
Parameters button. This will show the propagation parameter dialog for the 
model. An example is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 109 
 
 
 
 
Model Parameters for ITU-R Rec. P.452 
A description of the available propagation models is given in the Technical 
Annex. 
3.5.2 
Creating Your Own Propagation Link Types 
You can create your own propagation Link types – an example application might 
be if you are modelling a mobile system with go and return links on widely 
different frequencies. In this case you may want to have ‘UHF Mobile’ and ‘VHF 
Mobile’ modelled as different Link Types.  
To do this, select Advanced from the Propagation menu. The custom 
propagation Link types dialog will appear.

Custom Propagation Types Dialog 
Click Add to add a new Propagation Link type. The edit dialog for the new Link 
type will appear. This is the same as the dialog for built in Link types, except that 
there is a field for the name at the top of the dialog.

Make your changes and click ok. You will be returned to the previous dialog. 
Click Close and then click the Propagation menu again. You will see your new

The Technical Annex contains a tutorial on propagation which is a useful 
introduction for the non-specialist on the selection and use of propagation 
models for interference analysis.  
3.6 
Links 
3.6.1 
Introduction 
Link objects are used in Visualyse to: 
• 
Connect Stations together 
• 
Define parameters related to the propagation of radio waves 
• 
Set the criteria by which interference levels are judged 
The Link is where Stations, Carriers, frequencies, propagation models, 
interference criteria and interference statistics gathering are combined to define 
a communications path. 
3.6.2 
The Links Dialog 
The Links Dialog can be invoked in the normal ways, i.e. 
• 
Via the toolbar icons 
• 
Via the Model menu 
• 
By right mouse click in the Model View 
There are four types of Link that you can create, depending on what you want to 
do. 
A Fixed Link has explicitly defined start and end Stations, which do not change 
during the simulation, but which are not necessarily fixed Stations. Many 
modelling scenarios call for the use of fixed links.  
A Receive Link has an explicitly defined end Station, but no defined start 
Station. This type of Link could be used for earth observation satellites for 
example, or in any case where a fixed receive signal is known. 
A Transmit Link has an explicitly defined start Station (or Group of Stations) but 
no defined end Station. This type of Link would be used for a broadcast system 
being considered only as an interferer. Receive Stations are not relevant to the 
scenario and can therefore be omitted. 
User Guide 
 
Page 112 
 
 
 
The ‘source’ of a transmit Link multiple Stations, multiple beams and multiple 
Antennas. So, for example, if you have a Group of two Stations each with two 
Antennas which themselves have two beams there are various ways of 
specifying a transmit Link:  
• 
Both Stations transmitting through both their Antennas using all beams, or: 
• 
One Station transmitting through both Antennas using both beams, or: 
• 
One Station transmitting through one Antenna using both beams, or: 
• 
One Station transmitting through one Antenna using one beam. 
In a Dynamic Link the start and/or end Station, are selected from a group 
according to one of several criteria that may vary through the simulation. For 
example, in the case of a non-GSO satellite constellation, the feeder Link Earth 
Stations will experience handover from satellite to satellite that will be dependent 
on elevation angle. This would be modelled as a Dynamic Link in Visualyse. 
Fixed and Dynamic Links contain two Link Paths, one for the forward 
communication direction and one for the return direction. Forward and return 
directions are defined in relation to the start and end Stations, the forward path 
always running from the start Station to the end Station. Each direction can have 
separately defined powers and criteria. 
A Receive Link has a single Link Path into the receive while a transmit Link has 
no Link Paths at all. 
All Link dialogs have an option to change how Links are shown on the map and 
3D views. This is done via a combination of the ‘Display’ button in the Link 
dialog and the Link display method in the configure option of the view menu. 
The Link dialog also defines the powers, propagation characteristics and the 
interference criteria levels for the Links.  
The dialog is in the form of tabbed sheets. Each tab is described in detail below. 
Tabs that are common to more than one Link type are described first.  
3.6.3 
Fixed Link 
The dialog has five tabs (six if you have the Traffic Module enabled). 
The first two tabs define the start and end points of the Link. The next two define 
the parameters associate with the link in the both directions, and the final tab is 
labelled ‘Advanced’. 
3.6.3.1 Start & End Stations 
The Start Tab of the Fixed Link dialog is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 113 
 
 
 
 
Fixed Link Dialog  
Select a Station to define the starting point of the Link from the drop-down list. If 
any Stations appear in Groups, the Groups will be shown, and you can expand 
each Group to show the Stations it contains. 
 
Selecting Stations  
If the selected Station has multiple Antennas or Beams, you will need to select 
from these as well. 
The end station tab is the same as the start station tab except for the antenna 
and beam labelling.  
3.6.3.2 Link Paths 
Each Link can have two associated Link Paths. These are associated with two 
possible directions of communications for each Link, allowing you for example to 
model up links and down links without too much input data duplication. The Link 
Paths are called: 
• 
Start to End – in the direction start station to end station 
User Guide 
 
Page 114 
 
 
 
• 
End to Start – in the direction end station to start station 
The Start→End tab is shown below. 
 
Start to End Tab 
End to start and start to end tabs work in exactly the same way. 
You can specify whether the link path is enabled or not using the check box at 
the top of the tab. 
Frequency and Bandwidth of the Link 
On each active Link Path you must select a Carrier (which defines the 
bandwidth) and a centre frequency. 
Transmitter 
For the start to end link path, this will be the start station. The main feature of the 
transmitter is its power. Power is made more compact by allowing you to say 
how you want to specify it before asking you for the relevant parameters. You 
can choose from the following options: 
• 
Fixed power level: the power level is a fixed value 
• 
Adaptive power control the power level changes to achieve a target receive 
level 
• 
Constant receive power 
 the receive level is fixed 
• 
Random (specify limits) 
power is random between some user defined limits 
• 
Random (limits from antenna) power is random between the limits defined 
in the antenna 
For the return direction (End→Start) there are two additional power options: 
• 
Radar reflection 
User Guide 
 
Page 115 
 
 
 
• 
Listen before transmit 
More information on how to use these two options is given in the Technical 
Annex. 
Tip: 
Note that the transmit power is referenced at the input to the antenna. See the 
Technical Annex for more information about link reference points. 
Receiver 
For the start to end link path, the end station is a receiver.  
The main feature of the receiver is the specification of system noise. This is 
shown diagrammatically in the bottom right of the dialog.  
If the calculate system noise option is selected, the software will compute the 
system noise from the temperatures and losses at the antenna and feeder you 
have already provided in the Antenna and Station dialogs. These contributions 
are shown on the diagram. The receiver noise figure must be provided to 
complete the calculation. 
 
Calculating Noise 
If the noise is not being calculated, the diagram is greyed out and a box is 
provided for the system noise figure.  
 
Specifying Noise 
Note that the reference point is immediately after the antenna feed. The feeder 
loss is specified in the Station dialog (see Section 3.2.2.2.2) for each Antenna. If 
you want to do your calculations at a reference point immediately after the 
antenna you should put zero in the for the feeder loss and specify the system 
noise directly. 
If you have a rain model switched on (see Section 2.1) you can optionally 
include the increase in noise on a Link due to scattering by rain.  
User Guide 
 
Page 116 
 
 
 
3.6.3.3 Advanced Options 
The advanced tab allows you to override the propagation and statistics that are 
specified at simulation level. You can also set the link colour. This is shown 
below. 
 
Link Advanced Tab 
If you decide to override the default propagation models, click the Propagation 
models button. This will display the propagation options dialog. 
 
Propagation Options 
User Guide

The default models for the link type will be displayed. Click “Change Models” to 
change the models that are used for this link. Double-click on a model or select 
it and click “Edit Parameters” to change the default parameters used for that 
model. 
The statistics options work in the same way. 
3.6.3.4 Traffic 
As with Stations, the Traffic tab will not be shown unless the traffic module is 
enabled. If traffic is enabled, an extra tab called Traffic will appear. 
You can decide whether to enable traffic modelling on the link and if so what 
traffic model to use. The Traffic modelling option is explained in the Module User 
Guide. 
3.6.4 
Receive Link 
Receive links have no transmitting capabilities. They are used to set up 
receivers to use as test points for interference measurement. They are the 
simplest of all the links consisting of a single station and some receiver 
characteristics. 
3.6.4.1 End tab 
The End Tab defines the station, antenna and beam which will form the end 
point of this receive link. Receive antenna and Receive beam choices only need 
to be made when the selected station has multiple antennas and multiple 
beams. 
 
Receive Link End Tab 
User Guide 
 
Page 118 
 
 
 
3.6.4.2 Receive tab 
The Receive tab is where the Link parameters are defined: it is shown in the 
figure below. 
 
Receive Link Receive Tab 
In this dialog you will need to: 
1. Select a Carrier and a frequency 
2. Define a nominal received level (note, only needed if you want to work with 
C/I or C/(N+I) criteria 
3. Define the link noise as per the Fixed Link dialog. 
If the calculate system noise option is selected, the software will compute the 
system noise from the temperatures and losses at the antenna and feeder you 
have already provided in the Antenna and Station dialogs. These contributions 
are shown on the diagram. The receiver noise figure must be provided to 
complete the calculation. 
 
Calculating Noise 
If the noise is not being calculated, the diagram is greyed out and a box is 
provided for the system noise figure.  
User Guide 
 
Page 119 
 
 
 
 
Specifying Noise 
Note that the reference point is immediately after the antenna feed. The feeder 
loss is specified in the Station dialog (see Section 3.2.2.2.2) for each Antenna. If 
you want to do your calculations at a reference point immediately after the 
antenna you should put zero in the for the feeder loss and specify the system 
noise directly. 
If you have a rain model switched on (see Section 2.1) you can optionally 
include the increase in noise on a Link due to scattering by rain.  
3.6.5 
Transmit Link  
A Transmit link contains only start Station(s). You can consider these simply as 
sources of interference and use them when you are not interested in the other 
end of the Link. 
It contains a tab defining the Start Station, Antenna and Beam. 
One important feature of a Transmit link is that the source can be defined as 
multiple beams, on multiple antennas and even multiple stations. In the Transmit 
link, you just switch on all stations and the interference is aggregated.  
A tab called Transmit and the Advanced Tab as per the Fixed Link dialog (see 
Section 3.6.3.3) 
The Transmit Tab is shown below: 
User Guide 
 
Page 120 
 
 
 
 
Transmit Link Transmit Tab 
On this tab you need to define: 
1. The carrier – selected from a drop-down list of existing carriers 
2. The frequency – and whether you will use the antenna default frequency or 
a fixed value. This point is subtle, but if you have multiple sources in your 
transmit link, you can implement a sort of frequency re-use pattern by using 
a different antenna, with different default frequency, for each source. 
3. What is the power level and whether this is fixed or taken from the antenna 
defaults. 
3.6.6 
Dynamic Link 
These differ from fixed links by the fact that the start and end stations can 
change as the simulation runs.  
The start→ end, end → start, Traffic and Advanced tabs are therefore the same 
as for Fixed Links (see Section 3.6.3). The only differences are the start and end 
station tabs. 
3.6.6.1 Start Station 
The start station tab is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 121 
 
 
 
 
Transmit Link Start Station Tab 
Two options are provided for the selection of start station use a named station 
(just like a fixed link) and use the end station of another link. The second option 
allows you to chain together Dynamic Links and therefore model, for example, 
the inter-satellite links in a non-GSO constellation. 
You must also select the Antenna and Beam to start the Link on. Select either a 
named Antenna and Beam or pick any Antenna/Beam combination capable of 
tracking the end station. If you take the second option, Visualyse will manage 
the available resources and select the first available antenna. 
 
Antenna Selection 
Select either ‘Any tracking antenna’ or an antenna from the list. 
Beam selection is a little more complex. The options are shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 122 
 
 
 
 
Dynamic Link Beam Selection 
Beam selection options are: 
• 
Any tracking beam – Visualyse will choose the first available steerable 
beam 
• 
Highest gain beam – Visualyse will choose a beam from the selected 
antenna that has the highest gain 
• 
Nearest beam – Visualyse will choose a beam from the selected antenna, 
whose boresight latitude and longitude are closest to the location of the 
End station. 
3.6.6.2 End Station 
The End tab for a Dynamic Link is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 123 
 
 
 
 
Dynamic Link End Tab 
The unique feature of the End Station selection is the use of a ‘Tracking 
Strategy’. 
3.6.6.2.1 Tracking Strategy 
Select a Tracking Strategy from the drop-down list. You can choose either a 
built-in strategy or a strategy you can define yourself (see Section 3.8). 
Each built in tracking strategy has a set of parameters needed to fully define it. 
Each strategy must be applied to a specific Group of Stations (see Section 3.3) 
and this is selected by clicking on the highlighted text labelled “Track a Station 
from”. 
As an example of other parameters needed, the tracking strategy we call 
‘Constrained Elevation’ allows you to track a station that has the highest 
elevation but meets the constraint that the elevation is between two limits. This 
is shown below. 
 
Constrained Elevation 
The parameters you can change are bold and highlighted. As you pass the 
mouse over them, the cursor will change. Click and you can edit them. Click 
away or press Return, and your changes are made. 
User Guide 
 
Page 124 
 
 
 
For items that are not values, but items selected from a list e.g. the Station 
Group to be tracked, the operation is slightly different. The cursor changes to a 
hand when you pass over the item. Click and hold to produce a pop-up list, then 
drag to the item you want and release. The non-GSO and Highest elevation 
options in the example work in this way. 
  
 
1. Click and Hold to Change Selection 
The following tracking strategies have been built into the simulation and can be 
selected directly on the End Station tab of the Dynamic Link 
Track a Single Station 
This tracking strategy isn’t really a tracking ‘strategy’ at all because it always 
tracks the same station.  
 
Track a Single Station 
Constrained Elevation 
Several parameters need to be given to fully specify this tracking strategy: 
• 
The Group (constellation) to select Stations from 
• 
The elevation constraint type  
• 
Up to two constraining angles (depending on the constraint type) 
User Guide 
 
Page 125 
 
 
 
The selection criterion where more than one stations meets the constraints. 
 
Constrained Elevation 
Constrained Distance 
This is the same as Constrained Elevation, except that distance from the start 
station is the constraint. 
 
Constrained Distance 
GSO Arc Avoidance 
In this strategy the angle between the candidate station and the nearest point on 
the geostationary arc,  
End stations are only considered if the angle between them, the start station and 
the GSO arc is above a minimum value. Once again, in the case where there 
are multiple candidates, the station with the highest elevation or longest hold 
time is selected. 
 
GSO Arc Avoidance 
Avoid Constellation 
This tracking strategy ensures that the end station chosen such that the angles 
between it, the start station and every other station in a given constellation are 
above a particular minimum value.  
What we’re saying here is make sure that the start station doesn’t pick an end 
station that would have it pointing too close to any of the stations in another 
constellation. 
User Guide 
 
Page 126 
 
 
 
 
Avoid Constellation 
Nearest 
This selects the nearest Station from the Group of possible Stations. 
 
Nearest 
Longest Hold Time 
This selects the Station from the Group of possible Stations that is heading 
towards the start Station and could be tracked for the longest possible time 
without requiring handover. This is done by calculating the dot product of relative 
position and velocity vectors. 
 
Longest Hold Time 
 
Furthest from GSO Arc 
This selects the Station that has largest angle as seen by the start Station 
towards the GSO Arc. 
 
Furthest from GSO Arc 
 
Highest Elevation 
This tracking strategy selects the highest elevation Station as seen by the Start 
Station from the selected Group.

3.6.6.2.2 Antenna and Beam Options 
Selection of the end station also requires that the Antenna and Beam be 
specified. For the Antenna you can select: 
• 
Highest gain antenna 
• 
Any tracking antenna 
• 
Select an antenna by name. 
Beam selection options are: 
• 
Any tracking beam – Visualyse will choose the first available steerable 
beam 
• 
Highest gain beam – Visualyse will choose a beam from the selected 
antenna that has the highest gain 
• 
Nearest beam – Visualyse will choose a beam from the selected antenna, 
whose boresight latitude and longitude are closest to the location of the 
End station. 
If this Link is to be bi-directional you can select a different Antenna and Beam for 
the End→Start path.

Links can be associated in Link Groups, which are useful in a number of cases. 
For example: 
• 
To ease the analysis of systems that contain many Links 
• 
For service area analysis 
• 
Analysis of performance of FS Links operating various kinds of diversity 
• 
Combining up and down Link performance for satellite systems. 
Links can be in more than one Link Group at the same time. However, when 
defining Interference Paths that include Link Groups as sources of interference it 
would be easy to double count some Links if care is not taken in the assignment 
of Links to multiple Link Groups. 
Three kinds of Link Groups can be created in Visualyse, as shown in the figure 
below.

Link Group Type Selection Dialog 
Link Group - Created Empty 
Empty Link groups can be a useful way of managing many Links. An example 
use would be to look at the effect of a single new Link on many existing Links. 
One option in Visualyse is to create multiple Interference Paths, one for each 
existing Link. The second option is to put all the existing Links into a Link group 
and use that Link group as the Wanted Link. 
System Link Group  
This Link Group contains a set of Links plus a method for calculating the Link 
quality of the overall group and also defines how statistics will be collected for 
the Group.2 
Link to Station Group Wizard 
 
This sets up and manages Links to and from Station Groups. This may be used 
in service area analysis for example, where the worst point in a geographic area 
could be found by analysing Links to many test point Stations 
Statistics can be calculated for: 
• 
The current time step, based on statistics gathered from all Links in the 
Group 
• 
The whole simulation run, based on statistics gathered from all Links in the 
Group 
• 
The whole simulation run, based on a specific statistic which is calculated 
at each time step 
Statistics for each Station over the whole run can be obtained from  the 
individual Link to that Station. 
The Wizards can be re-run again to set new values. However, this could require 
Interference Paths that use some Links in the Link Group to be re-defined. 
Each Link Group type is now explained in detail 
 
2 The methods used to calculate overall Link group quality include Take Best Value for diversity analysis 
and Thermal Addition for analogue end-to-end performance.

3.7.2 
Link Group Created Empty 
Empty Link Groups are used as containers for Links. When there is a large 
number of Links in the simulation, it becomes easier to manage them using Link 
Groups. At the basic level, you can put all your victim links into one group and all 
your interferers into another.  
To create an empty Link Group click ‘add’ in the Link Group List (accessible via 
the Model menu or via the Link Group icon in the toolbar). Then select the first 
option – Link Group.  
A new Link Group, default name Basic Link Group will appear in the Link Group 
list. 
 
The Link Group List 
Double click on the Link Group or click the Edit button to edit the Link Group.  
The edit dialog has two tabs: 
1. The Links Tab – add and remove Links from the Link group here. 
2. The Advanced tab – to override simulation defaults for statistics collection 
and Link graphical display characteristics here. 
Above the tabs is the Link Group name – by default it will be Basic Link Group 
(or Basic Link Group 1, 2 etc). You can (should) change the name by click on it 
with the mouse. 
The Links Tab 
The Links tab is shown in the figure below. The function of this tab is to select 
Links from the simulation for inclusion into the Group and also for ordering the 
Links within the Group. 
User Guide 
 
Page 130 
 
 
 
 
Including Links into a Link Group 
The left pane shows all the Links defined in the simulation and the right pane 
shows those that are included in the Link Group.  
Transfers to and from the Group are via the 
 and 
 buttons.  
Select the Links you want to transfer by highlighting and then press the 
 
button to include or remove them from the Group. Alternatively, the 
 button 
will include or remove all the stations. 
Under certain circumstances, the order of Links within the Group can be 
important – for example, if the Links are Dynamic and ‘competing’ for resources 
such as Antennas and Beams, those at the top of the list will be processed first. 
To promote or demote a Link within the list, select the Link in the right pane and 
click the 
 button to promote and the 
 button to relegate. 
Filter the left pane contents using the filter edit field. 
The Advanced Tab 
The Advanced tab is used to override simulation defaults for Link colours and for 
the statistics that are collected. 
User Guide 
 
Page 131 
 
 
 
 
Basic Link Group Advanced Tab 
Statistics to be collected are defined for the simulation as a whole via the Output 
menu. This is where you tell Visualyse to collect and or all of C, N, I, C/N, C/N+I, 
I/N and PFD statistics, and where the threshold ratios are set. For each Link 
Group you can change the parameters collected and/or the thresholds.  
To override the simulation settings, check the ‘Override default statistics options’ 
and click the statistics option button. You will see the Statistics Collection 
Options tab. 
 
Configure Link Group Statistics 
Parameters that are selected in the simulation defaults (see the Overview 
section of this User Guide) will be checked – if you don’t want statistics on those

for this Link Group then uncheck them here. Check any additional parameters 
you want to analyse and set the threshold levels. 
Decide whether you want to generate histograms and the bin size (resolution) 
for the histograms. 
Links can be displayed on map and 3D views either according to the status of 
the Link (in terms of meeting threshold C/X levels) or according to display 
properties set here. Click the ‘Link Colour’ button and select the colours to use 
when displaying the Links in this group. 
3.7.3 
System Link Group 
This type of Link allows Links of groups to be associated and the calculation of 
statistics across the group to be defined in various ways.  
One application of this kind of Link Group is to look at the effects of diversity  on 
the performance of a single hop system. 
To create a System Link Group click ‘add’ in the Link Group List (accessible via 
the Model menu or via the Link Group icon in the toolbar). Then select the first 
option – System Link Group.  
A new Link Group, default name System Link Group will appear in the Link 
Group list. 
 
The Link Group List 
Double click on the Link Group or click the Edit button to edit the Link Group.  
The edit dialog has three tabs: 
1. The Links Tab – add and remove Links from the Link group here. 
2. The Advanced tab – override simulation defaults for statistics collection and 
Link graphical display characteristics here. 
3. The Calculation tab – define how statistics over the whole group are 
calculated. 
User Guide 
 
Page 133 
 
 
 
The first two tabs are the same as for the Created Empty Link Group: the 
System Link Group has in addition the “Calculation” tab. 
The Calculation Tab is where you tell the software how to deal with the 
calculations across multiple links at each time step 
 
Link Group Calculation Tab 
The effect of the various options is described in more detail in the Link Group 
statistics section 3.7.5 
3.7.4 
Link to Station Group  
A Group of Links can be defined to or from a Station Group. This type of Link 
group has an associated Wizard to help create it.  
The Link to Station Group requires a template Link. This can either be selected 
from the Link list or defined within the Wizard by clicking the Edit button on the 
first Wizard sheet 
All Link types except Transmit can be used as a template Link in this Wizard.  
Having defined the Link to use, the next stage is to define the start and end 
points of the multiple Links. The Link components dialog is shown below.  
User Guide 
 
Page 134 
 
 
 
 
Link Group Wizard 
The Link Group can start or end at each Station of any Station Group in the 
simulation. The other end of each Link must be a Station named explicitly. 
The next two screens (one if using a Receive Link as your template) define the 
elements to be used for the start and end of the Links. Note that the Stations in 
the Station Group must have at least one Antenna and beam name in common.  
 
Link Group Wizard Select Start Station, Antenna and Beams 
User Guide

Link Group Wizard Select End Station, Antenna and Beams 
Once you have created this Link Group, you can edit the Group. Select it in the 
Link Group list and click edit. 
There are two tabs, one defining the membership of the group and a second 
Advanced tab, similar to the two previous types of Link Group. 
3.7.5 
Link Group Statistics 
When we have a group of Links it is possible to look at statistics in three ways: 
• 
Current time step statistics derived from the values of parameters across all 
links at a single time step 
• 
By aggregating all parameter values across all Links at many time steps  
• 
By selecting one Link at each time step (according to some criterion), build 
up statistics over many time steps. 
We refer to these options as Statistics Now, Statistics All and Calculation 
Statistics. 
3.7.5.1 Calculation Statistics 
Under Calculation Statistics there are several options for the selection criterion. 
These are: 
• 
Thermal addition 
• 
Maximum Power Combining 
• 
Take Best/Worst Link. 
Thermal Addition 
Select this option if you have a Link Group that represents a series of hops in an 
analogue communications chain. Note that the ordering of the Links in the Link 
Group will represent the order of Links in the chain. 
User Guide 
 
Page 136 
 
 
 
Under this option, the single value used in compiling statistics is the value on the 
final Link in the group, but noise is assumed to accumulate along the chain. So 
the noise in Link 3 has a contribution from the noise and interference on Link 2, 
for example. 
The C/X value used is given by:

Maximum Power Combining 
Select this option if your Links represent diversity paths between the same two 
points. In this case, the multiple carriers are combined in such a way that they 
remain in phase, and add in a maximal sense.

(values in absolute, not dB).

Worst / Best 
Here the contribution to the statistics is taken from worst or best link (according 
to some defined criterion) at each time step. This could give you the answer to 
the question ‘For what percentage of time is at least one link suffering 
interference?’ 
Choose the third option ‘Take the value of ….’. On this dialog as in others, the 
bold highlighted text implies a user selection is to be made. Here you can select 
worst link or best link.  
By default, the calculated I statistics will be formed from those Links with the 
best (i.e. lowest) I and C statistics from the Link with the best C. However you 
can select the best Link based on any C/X criterion and calculate all statistics 
and further you can decide to keep with the this Link until the C/X falls below a 
threshold value. 
Let’s look at an example to see why these features are present.  
Consider a Gateway Station tracking a constellation of non-GSO satellites. You 
want to know the interference statistics into the downlink to that Gateway. At any 
one time, the Gateway may be tracking, say four satellites. The Satellite used for 
the communications Link will initially be the one with the best BER (or C/(N+I)), 
but this will be used until the BER rises above a certain value (or equivalently 
C/N+I falls). 
To simulate this, set up four links in a System Link Group and choose best Link 
by C/(N+I) and stay with a Link until C/(N+I) falls below the threshold. 
User Guide

3.7.5.2 Example of the Three Types of Statistic 
The following example illustrates how the different statistics are derived from all 
the possible values.

Statistics Now would consider at each time step the distribution of C/I. So at 
t=20 this would be the three values C/I = {15, 8, 22}. 
Statistics All would be the 12 values C/I = {25, 21, 15, 17, 27, 18, 8, 14, 22, 23, 
22, 24}. 
If Calculation statistics was using the worst case, then the worst value at each 
time step would be used, and the distribution would be the four values C/I = {22, 
18, 8, 14} 
3.8 
Tracking Strategies 
3.8.1 
Overview of Tracking Strategies 
Definition: A method applied by a single station, in the selection of a Station to 
communicate to from a Station Group. 
In Visualyse, Tracking Strategy objects can be applied to the end station 
selection in Dynamic Links.  
The method is based on a series of constraints on geometric parameters. The 
constraints are applied to the end station selection of a Dynamic Link (see 
Section 3.6.6.2). 
Visualyse has a number of built in strategies and also has a facility to allow you 
to create your own strategies.  
The Tracking Strategies list dialog can be invoked in the normal ways, i.e. 
1. Via the toolbar icon 
 
2. Via the Model menu 
3. By right mouse click in the Model view 
The first two brings up the Tracking Strategy list from where Tracking Strategies 
can be Added, Modified, Duplicated and Deleted. 
3.8.2 
The Selection Process 
The concept of the Tracking Strategy is to select a preferred Station or 
Station(s) that could be used by a Dynamic or Load Link. They can be used in 
any situation where there is choice – most typically because in the dynamic 
simulation the relative positions of the various stations are changing. 
Examples include: 
User Guide 
 
Page 138 
 
 
 
• 
Terrestrial mobile network: a mobile selects the base station to use as it 
moves (for example along pre-defined route or with its location 
randomised) 
• 
Non-GSO network: an Earth Station will use a different one as the satellites 
fly overhead 
• 
Aeronautical telemetry: as the aircraft moves it will select a different control 
station to communicate with 
• 
Maritime voice: as the ship moves it will switch to a different coastal station 
A key factor here is there is one station that must select the end station of the 
Dynamic Link from a set of possible candidates. The Tracking Strategy is used 
to make that selection. 
Consider the example simulation below: 
 
Tracking Strategy Example 
In this case a maritime station has a choice of ten possible satellites to 
communicate with. Some will be clearly unsuitable – such as those below the 
horizon as seen by the ship. Hence there are rules that can be geometric that 
can be used to identify unsuitable candidates. In this case a simple rule could be 
used: 
Elevation angle of the satellite as seen by the ship should be at least 0 
This is sufficient for this example as ships in open water can see down to very 
low elevations. In other circumstances the rules might have to be much more 
complicated. 
In addition, there can be multiple candidates that all meet this minimal rule: in 
this case there are three satellites visible to the ship. 
Hence the basic Tracking Strategy has two stages: 
Reduction phase: select from all potential Stations a set of candidates that 
meet a defined set of criteria 
Selection phase: from the Stations that meet the selection criteria, sort by 
preference and (typically) use the highest preference Station 
User Guide 
 
Page 139 
 
 
 
An additional complication is that sometimes it is preferable to reduce the 
number of handovers and hence prefer to continue to use the end Station used 
in the previous time step while it continues to be acceptable (as defined by 
another set of criteria). 
These two stages are reflected in the controls to configure Tracking Strategies 
as described in the following section. 
3.8.3 
Configuring Tracking Strategies 
Tracking Strategies are configured via the following dialog: 
 
Configuring Tracking Strategies 
At the top is the name, as for all Visualyse Professional objects. 
After the name, the dialog comprises separate sections for the various stages in 
the selection process: 
“Stations must meet all/one of the following constraints”: this is used to define 
the Reduction Phase 
“Choose the…Edit…”: this is used to define the Selection Phase 
The “Handover Options” button can be used to give addition feature that can be 
used to keep tracking the Station used at the previous time step. 
Each of these components are described in the following sections 
3.8.4 
Reduction Phase Controls 
The reduction phase controls are shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 140 
 
 
 
 
Tracking Strategy Reduction Phase Controls 
The reduction phase involves defining a number of criteria that are used to 
identify whether each of the possible Stations within a Group of Stations is 
suitable for further consideration (i.e. within the selection phase). 
These criteria are geometric, using angles and distances and other geometric 
values derived at the start point of the Link (e.g. in the examples above, the 
mobile, aircraft or ship). 
The first choice is whether they should all be met or whether it acceptable for the 
target to meet any one of them: that is done via the “All” or “One” option at the 
top. 
There is then a list of criteria, with controls to add, edit, duplicate and delete. If 
you click on add you will get a dialog that identifies the types of criteria that can 
be used, namely: 
 
Tracking Strategy Constraint Types 
User Guide 
 
Page 141 
 
 
 
You can have as many of these constraints as you like in a Tracking Strategy. 
Each constraint can then be modified using the edit button, which gives options 
such as shown below. 
 
Tracking Strategy Constraints 
This can then be modified to change the criteria to use, which can be one of: 
• 
Between: in which case it is necessary to enter the two extremes  
• 
Not between: in this case it is also necessary to enter two extremes 
• 
At least: in this case it is necessary to define the minimum acceptable 
value 
• 
At most in this case it is necessary to define the maximum acceptable 
value 
Hence in the dialog above the criteria is “at least” and the threshold is set to 10 
degrees – in other words the constraint is that target Stations should have an 
elevation angle of at least 10. 
3.8.5 
Selection Phase Controls 
The selection phase takes the sub-set of suitable end Stations from the 
reduction phase and orders them according to a criteria. The controls are shown 
below. 
 
Tracking Strategy Selection Controls 
There are built in the following standard selection criteria: 
• 
Highest elevation (useful for satellite selection) 
• 
Longest hold time (based upon whether the target end Station is heading 
towards the tracking Station or away from it) 
• 
Closest (useful for base station selection for terrestrial systems) 
• 
Furthest from the GSO arc (e.g. to undertake EPFD studies under Article 
22.2 of the Radio Regulations) 
• 
Random station (this can be very useful to just use this part of the Tracking 
Strategy to undertake some forms of Monte Carlo analysis) 
User Guide 
 
Page 142 
 
 
 
There is also an option to further customise the selection phase by clicking on 
“Advanced” and then defining using the following dialog: 
 
Tracking Strategy – Custom Selection Method 
The starting point is the ordering criteria which can be one of: 
• 
Elevation angle 
• 
Azimuth angle 
• 
Distance 
• 
Difference in latitude 
• 
Difference in longitude 
Then there is the sort order which can be either highest first or lowest first, and 
with options to take the highest or lowest in absolute. 
Finally, there is the preferred position on the list – i.e. the 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc highest 
on this sorted list 
There are additional fields to manage this list sorting process: 
• 
What to do if there are fewer Stations on the list than the preferred 
position? For example, if the preferred position is 3rd but there are only on 2 
on the list. A field can be used to either select the next best or for the link to 
fail. 
• 
What to do if the preferred Station has already been selected by an 
Antenna at the tracking Station? This would clearly be inefficient given 
Antennas are a limiting resource for the simulation. Hence the Tracking 
Strategy can check to avoid such duplication. 
• 
The converse is what to do if there are no available resources (e.g. tracking 
Antennas or electronically steerable Beams) available on the preferred end 
Station? Should the Link fail or take the second best? 
Note that the last of these effectively determines whether the Tracking Strategy 
returns a single Station (the preferred one) or a list of suitable ones, with the 
preferred one at the top. 
User Guide 
 
Page 143 
 
 
 
3.8.6 
Handover Options Controls 
An option within Tracking Strategies is to once an end Station has been selected 
at one time step, to continue to track it while it meets a certain set of criteria. 
This is done by the “Handover Options” as in the following dialog: 
 
Tracking Strategy Handover Options 
Note that these options are by default switched off so that the Tracking Strategy 
would at each time step start from scratch with the reduction and selection 
phases. 
If activated it allows a set of criteria to be used to determine whether the current 
end Station is still suitable. These criteria are the same as those in the reduction 
phase described above in section 3.8.4. 
The handover process can also be re-set after a specified number of time steps: 
this can model systems that are designed to avoid handover during a call. There 
are therefore options to continue tracking for: 
• 
Exactly a certain specified number of time steps 
• 
A number of time steps selected at random with uniform density between 
zero and an entered value 
3.9 
Interference Paths 
The interference scenario is defined in terms of any number of Interference 
Paths. An interference path consists of a wanted Link or Link Group and a 
number of interfering Links or Link Groups.  
All Links defined in the simulation are available for selection as interferers. 
Where multiple Links are defined as interferers, the aggregate interference 
power is automatically calculated. 
User Guide 
 
Page 144 
 
 
 
The Interference Paths dialog can be invoked in the normal ways, i.e. 
1. Via the toolbar icon 
2. Via the Model menu 
3. By right mouse click in the Model view 
There are three parts to the dialog: 
• 
Select the Victim Links 
• 
Select the Interfering Links 
• 
An advanced tab where you define the interference calculation options 
Select the Victim Link(s) 
Select either a Link Group or a Link from the Link List. If you select a Link Group 
only, Interference paths will be set up for all Links in that group. 
 
Interference Path – Victim Link Selection 
Select the Interfering Link(s) 
On the interfering links tab, the list off all potential interferers is displayed in the 
left-hand pane. Any Links or Link Groups currently selected as interferers are 
shown in the right-hand pane. 
User Guide 
 
Page 145 
 
 
 
 
Interference Path – Interfering Links Selection 
Where a Link or Link Group is bi-directional, both directions (start – end and end 
start) are given as options. 
To include a Link Path as an interferer, move it to the right-hand pane using the 
arrow buttons.  
Advanced Interference Path Options 
The Advanced tab includes several parameters that have an effect on the 
interference calculation. 
User Guide 
 
Page 146 
 
 
 
 
Interference Path –Advanced Tab 
Each calculation option is described below 
Force Co-frequency  
Checking the “Force Co-Frequency” box forces all interfering Links to be co-
frequency with the wanted Link, for this interference path only. This option is 
used for worst case analysis. 
An example use of this option would be if many interfering Links have been 
entered with different frequencies according to some channel plan, and a worst-
case analysis is required. The worst-case analysis may not include the channel 
plan. Forcing co-frequency would allow the existing Links to be used without 
losing the channel plan data. 
This option should not really be used to scale systems from, say C-band to 
Ku-band. The adjustment is only applied when the bandwidth overlap factor is 
calculated. Therefore, frequency Antenna characteristics and pathloss would not 
be accounted for correctly. 
Check Overlap  
Where out of band emissions are of interest, it may be that you want to include 
interferers that have no frequency overlap with the wanted carrier. In 
combination with frequency off-set advantage, the Check Overlap option can be 
used to model the effect of out of band or spurious emission. 
If Check Overlap is set then all interferers must have overlap in their allocated 
bandwidths to be included in the interference calculation. If it is not set then 
interfering paths will be included whether or not they have overlap in bandwidth.  
Exclude Wanted Beams 
User Guide 
 
Page 147 
 
 
 
This option is useful when analysing intra-system interference and considering a 
Link Group as the wanted element in the interference path. 
In this case the wanted Links would also be used as interferers i.e. you can 
select the same Link Group as the interfering element.  
With the Exclude Wanted Beams option selected, interference into a particular 
wanted Link would be considered from all the other Links in the group, but not 
from any links using the transmit beam of the wanted Link. 
Include On-Tune Rejection for Radar Systems 
If this field is activated and the relevant Carriers have the radar fields defined, 
then the On Tune Rejection (OTR) will be calculated according to ITU-R Rec. 
M.1461 “Procedures for determining the potential for interference between 
radars operating in the radiodetermination service and systems in other 
services” 
Calculate Interfering Signal using Victim Frequency 
When using the IMT-MODEL gain pattern (e.g. for IMT-2020 or 5G studies) 
there can be a different gain pattern for co-frequency and non-co-frequency 
scenarios. The way to define this in the Antenna Type is described in Section 
3.1.2.4. 
By default the interfering signal is always calculated using the centre frequency 
of the interfering link. However to activate the non-co-frequency gain patterns it 
is necessary to use the centre frequency of the victim link. 
This can be achieved by checking the option “Calculate Interfering Signal using 
Victim Frequency”. 
If this is enabled then the interfering signal will be calculated using the victim 
centre frequency and hence allow the antenna type to identify if the path is co-
frequency (to the IMT-MODEL antenna) or non-co-frequency.  
Note that this will not affect other calculations, in particular the mask integration 
adjustment or NFD. 
Polarisation Advantage 
When polarisation advantage is included, the interfering power level may be 
reduced by a set amount.  
The options available in the drop-down list are: 
• 
None 
• 
ITU Radio Regs 
• 
User Defined 
The table below shows the numerical ratios to be used for polarisation isolation 
between two carriers when the Radio Regulations option is selected. 
When User Defined is selected, this table is available for editing via the dialog 
below. By default, the advantage is only applied when there is main beam to 
main beam coupling between the wanted receiver and the interfering transmitter. 
The same user defined table is used for all Links 
User Guide 
 
Page 148 
 
 
 
 
Polarisation Advantage Table 
Frequency Offset Advantage  
It is possible to define a dB advantage relating to the offset of the centre 
frequencies of the wanted and interfering carrier. The effect is to reduce the 
interfering carrier level or (equivalently the wanted receiver response) by a 
number of dBs at each defined frequency off-set. 
This could be used, for example, to model the out of band interference of a 
narrow band carrier into a wide band receiver with a known filter characteristic. 
The filter characteristic would be reflected in the off-set advantage. 
Details of the effect on the interference calculation are given in the Technical 
Annex. 
If multiple interferers are defined, they will all be affected by the frequency off-
set advantage. 
To use this advantage make sure the Use Frequency Dependent Advantage’ 
box is checked. The characteristic shape can be edited by clicking the Change 
button. The following table will then be available. 
User Guide 
 
Page 149 
 
 
 
 
Frequency Offset Table Definition 
You edit the table directly or use Copy/paste of data from other applications. 
Other Advantages 
The Other Advantages field can be used to specify a dB value to be added or 
subtracted from each interfering signal. This may be used in a number of ways. 
For example, a real value for polarisation advantage might be known from 
Antenna performance data and from the polarisation plan definition. The 
polarisation isolation would be entered as a positive number in this field. 
Alternatively, this factor could be used to model carrier fading (when C/I is being 
considered) by entering a negative number in this field. The negative number 
may be equal to the expected rain fade for example. 
Bandwidth Adjustment Factor. 
The various possibilities for bandwidth adjustment factor determine how the 
overlap between the wanted and interfering carrier is taken into account. 
 
Bandwidth Adjustment Options 
The options available are: 
User Guide 
 
Page 150 
 
 
 
• 
Based on spectral density - ignoring bandwidth factors and taking the ratio 
of spectral densities as the C/I 
• 
Assuming multiple interfering carriers - where the interferer has a narrower 
bandwidth than the wanted carrier, interferers are stacked into the wanted 
carrier bandwidth. If the interferer has a wider bandwidth than the wanted 
carrier then the overlap of the two is calculated. 
• 
Based on overlap of a single carrier - this explicitly calculates the proportion 
of the interferer that falls into the wanted bandwidth 
• 
Integrate masks – calculates the Net Filter Discrimination (NFD) based 
upon the TX and RX masks. There are a number of alternative NFD 
calculation methods as described in the Technical Annex. 
• 
None - the ratio returned in this case is just the ratio of the total received 
powers of the wanted and interfering carrier at the wanted receiver. 
Each option is described in detail in the Technical Annex.

Configure and Run Simulations  
This section of the User Guide concerns the set-up and analysis of simulation 
runs, using elements and a scenario already created.  
This section is structured in the following way. 
Section 4.1 describes how to set run parameters including duration, time step 
resolution. 
Section 4.2 gives details of how to change the properties of the map and 3D 
view windows to improve the graphical feedback you are getting from Visualyse. 
Section 4.3 shows how to modify large groups of objects using the Change 
Variable wizard. 
4.1 
Run Parameters 
This section describes the default options that can be defined in Visualyse, and 
also how the different views can be configured. Configuration of the graph views 
is described in Section 5.2.2.  
4.1.1 
Visualyse Default Parameters 
A number of default settings will apply to all simulations opened on your PC. 
These settings are defined via the File menu item. 
Selecting 'Visualyse Settings' from the File menu brings up the following dialog 
box. 
 
Simulation Level Settings for Default Parameters.  
Run Status (shown in the bottom right of the can be displayed in one of four 
ways: 
• 
Time of day – the current simulation day, hour, minute, second and 
millisecond is shown 
• 
Percentage Run – based on the number of time steps specified and the 
number already executed, the percentage of the run completed is shown 
User Guide 
 
Page 152 
 
 
 
• 
Elapsed time – shows the elapsed time simulated since the start of the 
simulation 
• 
Time step – the number of time steps already executed is displayed. 
Display Precision determines how many decimal places are shown in the 
calculated fields in Visualyse dialogs. You can also determine whether to trim all 
trailing zeroes.  
Defaults – when objects are created in Visualyse they have an associated 
frequency. This can be edited in the object dialog, but initially will be simulation 
default value that is set here. You also decide whether an antenna and carrier 
are created by default in each new simulation and whether 
Logs/Statistics/Define Variables are duplicated when duplicating SIM objects. 
The final option is the default size of the ground track. 
Optimisations may have some effect on the speed at which a simulation runs:  
• 
Calculation of lat/long histories is needed if you are going to display ground 
tracks. If not they are simply an un-necessary overhead 
• 
Calculation of beam az/el for tracking beams is needed if you are going to 
collect statistics or do some other analysis on these pointing angles. Within 
Visualyse geometry is calculated in our internal Cartesian co-ordinates and 
for beam that track, the simulation can work directly in these co-ordinates. 
• 
Rate of change of antenna pointing: only enable this option if you are 
interested in it specifically. 
GIMS – selecting the ‘Use GIMS Shaped Beams’ option means that when using 
contour beams, the interpolation to points between  the contours will use the 
GIMS algorithm rather than any of the other options that you can define in the 
Antenna Dialog (see Section 3.1.1.3). It is important to note that if you do not 
have the latest GIMS DLLs installed on your PC, this function will not work and 
the software will default to linear interpolation, no error message will be 
generated when this happens. 
You can also set the location of the ITU GIMS Database by clicking on the "..." 
button and selecting an appropriate database. 
Startup – check for updates. You can get Visualyse Professional to by default 
check online for a new release. This might require you to change the settings on 
your firewall to give Visualyse Professional permission to access the internet. 
Graphics  
• 
Use high-resolution terrain graphics – You can set whether Visualyse 
Professional will use high-resolution graphics when drawing terrain data 
on the Map Views. Note: users with limited graphics card memory are 
advised to leave this unchecked (the default setting). 
• 
Use Direct 2D for Graphs – Disable this setting on PCs where there are 
noticeable performance issues when displaying graphs with a lot of 
graphical elements. Note: this only tends to happen on low powered 
graphics cards. 
• 
Use Direct 2D for 2D Maps – Disable this setting to use “classic” 
OpenGL. This may be beneficial in some scenarios. 
Autosave – save when SIM end. You can set whether Visualyse Professional 
will automatically save the file when the SIM reaches the end. 
User Guide

4.1.2 
Population Data Settings 
Selecting “Population Data Settings” from the File menu allows you to set the 
directory that contains the population data files: 
 
The population database is the NASA gridded population of the World (GPW). 
This gives the population in each 30 arc-second pixels over the Earth’s surface 
from 60S to 85N.  
The data was downloaded from the Centre for International Earth Science 
Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University as described here: 
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-count-rev11 
Note the recommended citation for use of this data is: 
“Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - 
Columbia University. 2018. Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 
(GPWv4): Population Count, Revision 11. Palisades, New York: NASA 
Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). 
https://doi.org/10.7927/H4JW8BX5” 
The data was provided as 8 text format tiles of size 90 x 90 in (latitude, 
longitude), in total nearly 5 GB of data. To facilitate its use within Visualyse, this 
data was converted into just over a thousand binary files covering 5 x 5, each 
just over a megabyte in size, then collected into a zip file. 
Two versions of this data were processed, namely that for 2015 and 2020. 
These can be downloaded from the Transfinite website: 
https://www.transfinite.com/content/population_data 
Having downloaded the relevant zip file, the files it contains should be extracted 
into a directory on your PC, for example something like: 
D:\5_deg_population_files_2015_gpw-v4-rev11 
D:\5_deg_population_files_2020_gpw-v4-rev11 
Note that Visualyse Professional checks the directory to ensure there are the 
required number of files and they all are the right size. 
More information is available in the White Paper on using Population Data in 
Visualyse Professional. 
4.1.3 
Run Time Parameters and Simulation Control 
Selecting Time Settings from the Simulation menu, brings up the following dialog 
box 
User Guide 
 
Page 154 
 
 
 
 
Time Settings 
This is where the simulation start time, time step size and run duration 
parameters are defined. 
Start Time  
Selecting a date and then a time sets the simulation start time. Click on the date 
field and a popup calendar will appear. From here you can select a date. 
 
Date Selector 
User Guide 
 
Page 155 
 
 
 
The dates for the current month are shown. The currently selected date is 
highlighted in grey. Today’s date is shown with a red border around it. You can 
select another date in the current month by clicking on it. At that point the popup 
will disappear. You can automatically select today’s date by clicking the Today 
button. 
The black arrows allow you to change forward and backwards through the 
months. If you click and hold where the month is displayed, a pop-up will 
appear. From there, you can select from months around the currently selected 
month. If you try and select beyond the range in the pop-up, the list will scroll. 
 
You can also type directly into the date field. The software will recognise a 
number of different formats including all the standard abbreviations for months 
and years. 
Once the date has been set, you can then move on to change the time. The time 
can be entered in the edit box. 
 
Time Selection 
Note that you can type in a time that includes seconds or milliseconds. When 
seconds are present, the time is shown in the “00:00:00” format. When 
milliseconds are present, the time is shown in the “00:00:00.000” format. 
Time Step Size 
The most important time related parameter in most dynamic simulations is the 
step size. To change the time size, simply change what is written in the box. The 
software will take care of any problems with formatting. You can type the 
elapsed time in a number of formats. All of the following are accepted: 
Typing 
Interpreted as 
3:30 
three hours and thirty minutes 
2 days 45 mins 
two days and forty-five minutes 
1 mth 2 hrs 45 secs 
one month, two hours and forty-five seconds 
1:20:3.34 
one hour, twenty minutes, three seconds and 340 
milliseconds 
Once you have finished typing, press the return key, or tab away from the 
control. The return key will not close the dialog under these circumstances. 
Run Duration 
Run duration can be specified in one of three ways:  
• 
From the number of time steps 
• 
By defining the total elapsed time  
• 
Selecting picking an end time 
You can select which of these options you want to use by clicking on the 
appropriate check button. 
User Guide 
 
Page 156 
 
 
 
If you choose to specify a number of time steps, the elapsed time and end time 
will automatically be calculated and displayed. The equivalent applies for the 
other two. That way, all three are kept in synch.  
To change the elapsed time, simply change what is written in the box – the 
formatting is the same as for the time step size above. 
If the elapsed time or end time options are selected, the number of time steps 
will be recalculated. 
Simulation Video Style Controls 
The simulation can be controlled from the Simulation menu or by mouse clicks 
on the video controls 
The video control buttons are shown below.  
 
Each control is now described (working from left to right) 
Reset 
This resets the simulation to t = 0. All statistics collected are erased if the 
simulation is reset. Pressing this is equivalent to selecting reset from the Run 
menu. 
Stop 
This stops the simulation. This is equivalent to selecting Stop from the Run 
menu. 
Pause/Step 
The first time this button is pressed, the simulation is paused. Each subsequent 
time, the simulation is progressed by a single time step. This is equivalent to 
selecting Pause from the Run menu. The space bar can also be used to pause 
and step the simulation. However, the space bar only has this function when 
running in Interactive mode. 
Run Interactive 
This sets the simulation running, updating all views at each time step. This is 
equivalent to selecting Run Interactive from the run menu.  
Run Non-Interactive 
This sets the simulation running without updating any views. This gives optimum 
performance. Pressing this button is equivalent to selecting Run Non-Interactive 
from the Run menu. The simulation can be run even faster by pressing the 
space bar whilst running in Non-Interactive mode. This switches off all updates 
including those to the status bar. 
4.2 
View Properties 
Visualyse Professional includes a number of different types of View Window 
accessible from the Window menu or from the toolbar icon shown: 
  Plate Carrée view – a plane projection view of the simulation 
  Mercator view - a plane projection view of the simulation 
User Guide 
 
Page 157 
 
 
 
  3D view – an orthomorphic perspective projection view of the simulation 
from a point in space 
  Model view – a hierarchical view of the objects in the current simulation 
  Watch window – select a number of variables to ‘watch’ in a window  
  Table view – displays multiple parameters across multiple objects, e.g. 
look at the I/N of all victim Links within a Link Group 
  Terrain profile 
 Frequency view 
Each of the different types of view window can be customised in various ways. 
This section looks at the properties of each of the views. 
4.2.1 
Map View 
There are two forms of map view showing two types of projection, namely Plate 
Carrée and Mercator. For more information on these projections see: 
 
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projections 
These views can zoomed and panned using the move by: 
• 
To move the map: click the left mouse button and while held down move 
the move 
• 
To zoom the map in and out: use the mouse scroll wheel  
There are a number of mouse “modes”, including: 
 
Default mode – mouse moves the map 
 
Station move mode – mouse used to move stations 
 
Zoom mode – mouse used to select area to zoom into 
 
Terrain mode – mouse used to select area to load terrain region (see 
Modules User Guide) 
 
Path profile mode – mouse used to create new path profile (see Modules 
User Guide) 
 
Move path profile mode – mouse used to move any of the path profile 
start or end points (see Modules User Guide) 
 
Land Use mode – mouse used to select area to land use terrain region 
(see Modules User Guide) 
Selecting Properties from the View menu (with a Map window active) or 
 
button from the toolbar brings up the Edit Map View dialog.  
The properties dialog is also one of the options on the pop-up menu that can be 
accessed by right clicking on the map, as shown below: 
User Guide 
 
Page 158 
 
 
 
 
Map Views Pop-up Menu 
Note a slightly different menu will appear if you right click in locations where 
there is an Area Analysis, as discussed in section 5.3.4. 
This menu can be used to: 
• 
Create a new station at the position clicked 
• 
Jump to a specific country as in the figure below: 
 
Map Views Jump to Country Dialog 
• 
Export to Google Earth (as described in section 5.4) 
• 
Set the current view configuration as the default one so that all new views 
of that type will open configured to look identical to the present one 
• 
Restore Default Scheme: to change the configuration of the current view 
back to the default values 
• 
Properties: this opens up the view properties dialog. 
The view can be copied to clipboard using the Edit menu option or toolbar icon 
. 
The map view properties dialog consists of five tabs: 
• 
Features – the most regularly used features are presented in this tab 
• 
Adornments –grids, titles and tick marks are defined here 
• 
Overlays – here you can add Area Analyses, Terrain colours, Land use 
data and user defined bitmaps to enhance your output. 
• 
Path Profiles  
User Guide 
 
Page 159 
 
 
 
• 
Countries – schemes for colouring the map by country groups are defined 
here. 
Each tab is described in the following sub-sections. 
4.2.1.1 Features Tab 
The General tab is shown below. 
  
Map View Properties Features Tab 
Switch the beam footprint and the Links on and off by checking or unchecking 
the boxes. The options buttons allow you to change the display properties. 
Beam Options 
To change the beam display options, click the options button next to “Show 
beams”. This will bring up the beam display options dialog (shown below). 
User Guide 
 
Page 160 
 
 
 
  
Beam Display Options 
The dialog is split into two sections. The first section allows you to specify the 
footprints you want to display and their relative gain levels. Line styles can be 
selected for each beam contour that is being displayed. 
If you want to display several footprints between two relative gain levels, set the 
top and bottom contour levels to the extreme values and click “Space Levels 
Evenly” to automatically set the levels for the footprints in between. 
There is an option for filling the beam footprints with the line colour. Label 
display and formatting is also user definable. 
The “Colour Options” section allows you to choose how the beam footprints are 
coloured when displayed on the map view.  
The default option allows you to colour each footprint according to its relative 
gain level. Clicking next to the box where the level is set, sets the colour and line 
style. 
The other option is to colour beams according to the Station Group, Station, or 
Antenna that they belong to.  
To choose which one of these you want to colour by, select the ‘Colour 
according to’ radio button and click on the drop-down box activated next to the 
button. 
User Guide 
 
Page 161 
 
 
 
 
Colouring Footprints by Station 
The levels are still set at the top of the dialog. However, the colours are 
assigned according to the Group / Station / Antenna / Antenna Type.  
To change the colours associated with each Station Group, Station, Antenna, 
Antenna type, click Assign Colours. This will open the Assign Beam Colours 
dialog.  
 
User Guide 
 
Page 162 
 
 
 
 
Assign Beam Colours Dialog 
This dialog allows you to navigate to the objects you have chosen to colour by 
and select a colour and line style to apply to the beams. 
Link Display Options 
To change the link display options, click the Options button next to Show links. 
This will bring up the Link Display Options dialog (shown below). 
User Guide 
 
Page 163 
 
 
 
  
Link Display Options 
There are three options. You can display links according to one of the 
interference parameters (I, I/N, C/(N+I) etc.). The interference parameter is 
chosen from the drop-down list. You can then choose the colours for good, bad 
and unclear links. 
The other two options allow you to display the links in their own colours or in the 
colours of the link group. These colours are set by editing the individual Links 
and Link Groups themselves. 
Station Options 
Station names can be switched on and off for normal stations and for marker 
stations. The font can be set as well. All fonts will now be displayed at the font 
size you choose.  
Station ground track length can now be set on the dialog – note that this track 
length is applied to all map and 3D views. Colour and line style are set using the 
new line style control. 
Advanced Contouring 
This option can be used to produce contours that show how link and station 
variables change over an area. For example it could show contours of where the 
interfering signal strength reaches a certain level. 
As this is similar to the Area Analysis it is described further below in section 5.3. 
4.2.1.2 Adornments 
Adornments can be added to the view to explain what is being displayed or to 
enhance its appearance. The dialog is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 164 
 
 
 
 
Adornments Tab 
There are two sections to the adornments tab. The first deals with the 
latitude/longitude grid and the second deals with borers titles and axes. 
Latitude/Longitude Grid   
You can show or hide the latitude/longitude grid by ticking the check box at the 
top left of this tab. You can also set the line style for the grid lines. The grid size 
is defined by latitude and longitude spacing – type the number of degrees you 
want between each grid line in the boxes on the right-hand side of the dialog 
Border, Title and Axes 
If you switch this option on, a border will appear around the map area. You can 
change the colour of the border by clicking in the colour box. 
The view title and subtitle are displayed in the centre of the top part of the 
border. Labels are shown along the latitude and longitude axes. You can set the 
spacing for tick marks on these axes. The fonts for all these can be adjusted. 
When all the adornment options are switched on, the view will look something 
like the one below. 
User Guide

Example View with Border Activated 
4.2.1.3 Overlays  
The overlays tab allows you to add features to a map which will enhance your 
output aesthetically and can also add a large amount of easily digestible 
information. 
 
The Overlays Tab 
Overlays fall into four categories: 
1. Area Analysis – any analyses produced so far in the simulation can be 
overlaid on all views 
User Guide 
 
Page 166 
 
 
 
2. Terrain regions – if terrain data are included they can be selectively 
displayed as a colour coded overlay 
3. Land Use Regions – used in the determination of clutter loss, Land Use 
data can also be displayed as colour coded overlays. 
4. User Defined Overlays – allows you to add additional information onto the 
view including point, vector, and raster data, as explained below 
There are four types of User Defined Overlays, namely: point, vector, drawing 
objects and raster data. The required file formats for all overlays are described 
in the Technical Annex. 
Point data allows specific locations to be marked and given a label. An example 
of point data is the User Defined Overlay “Capital Cities of the World”, as in the 
figure below: 
 
Points Overlay: Capital Cities 
Vector data allows lines to be drawn at specific locations: this could be to show 
roads, railways, or borders. An example of vector data is the boundary of the 
Washington BEA licence as shown in the figure below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 167 
 
 
 
 
Vector Overlay: Washington BEA 
Drawing objects allows simple shapes (rectangles, ellipses and grids) to be 
drawn at specific locations. 
Raster data is graphical data such as maps but could include images of (say) 
population density or other information. These can cover the entire Earth or just 
a small part, defined using a rectangle. The example below shows a map from 
the Ordnance Survey (OS) in the UK overlaid on the Mercator view: 
 
Raster Overlay: OS Map of part of Wales 
Note that raster data will have been generated assuming a specific projection 
and therefore care should be taken when displaying on either the Plate Carrée 
or Mercator view to ensure it is appropriate. The 3D view works like a Plate 
Carrée at large scale (i.e. the whole Earth) and Mercator and small scale 
User Guide 
 
Page 168 
 
 
 
(zoomed far in). Vector and point user defined overlays will work in any 
projection. 
These four user defined overlays, together with the Area Analysis, terrain and 
land use overlays, mean that there is a lot of information that could be displayed 
on either of the map views or the 3D view. Indeed typically the key issue is how 
to select and configure what is shown. 
A number of controls can be used to manage what is shown on the views, 
including: 
• 
Check boxes to show or hide each of the items 
• 
Controls to change the order in which each layer is display 
• 
Controls to change the degree of transparency from one layer to the layers 
below 
The final image is built up by adding each layer on top of the other with the 
degree of transparency as requested. 
The result of combining these three layers is a composite in which the graphics 
are merged so that lower layer information can be seen due to the transparency 
of the higher layers. 
 
Final Graphic 
The arrow keys on the View Properties Overlay’s tab can be used to move the 
position of: 
• 
An overlay category (e.g. Area Analysis, Terrain, Clutter, User Defined) 
with respect to another overlay category 
• 
An overlay with respect to other overlays within that particular overlay 
category 
User Guide 
 
Page 169 
 
 
 
Select the item of interest (category or overlay) then click on the up or down 
arrow as required. 
To change the level of opacity (and hence its transparency) of an overlay, select 
it and then click on the Transparency control, as in the figure below. 
 
Modification of Overlay Transparency Level 
The following should be noted: 
• 
It is easy to overload the view with too many overlays: select the ones you 
want and hide others 
• 
The most important overlays should be highest on the list and less 
important ones lower down 
• 
The level of transparency of each overlay can be used to show more or 
less of the lower layers 
Tip Colours of terrain and land use pixels can be selected to avoid clashing with 
other overlays. For example if an area analysis of coverage from a base station 
uses green and yellow to plot signal strength, select different colours to show 
the terrain heights or land use codes. 
4.2.1.4 Path Profiles 
Where terrain path profile views have been created, they are indicated on map 
views as a coloured line. The Path Profiles dialog lets you control how that line, 
and any text associated with it, is displayed. 
User Guide 
 
Page 170 
 
 
 
 
Path Profiles Tab 
4.2.1.5 Countries 
The final tab on the Map View Properties dialog is the Countries tab. This allows 
you to set the display options for the country polygons in the map. 
  
Map View Properties Countries Tab 
User Guide 
 
Page 171 
 
 
 
The main function of this tab is to allow you to set the colours and outlines of the 
countries on the map. A list of all the countries is displayed on the left-hand side 
of the dialog. Each country has a coloured square next to it. This represents the 
colour and outline that will be used to display that country. 
To change a country’s colour, first select it in the list. At the top of the list are two 
controls one to select the colour and one to set the outline.  
When you change the colour or line-style, these will be set for the selected 
country. If you want to set these colours for another country, first select the new 
country. Now all you need to do is click the colour or outline button itself (not the 
drop-down) and that colour or style will be applied. 
You can change more than one country at once by applying colours and styles 
to a multiple selection. You can also click the Colour All button to apply the 
current colours to all the countries in the list. 
At the bottom of the list is a drop-down that allows you to show only certain 
groups of countries. Examples are - All countries, Continents and ITU regions. 
Having selected a group, you could apply colours to all countries in the group. 
As well as country colours, you can select whether to show US state borders or 
rivers and lakes. You can also choose the sea colour. 
Choose whether you want to show country names. The font can be set for these 
as before. However, fonts will now be displayed at their actual point size. 
4.2.2 
3D View 
The 3D view display properties are almost identical to the map view properties. 
There are however a few small differences. 
On the features tab, in addition to ground tracks, an option to display space 
tracks is provided. 
It isn’t possible to use the border feature and the countries cannot be displayed 
individually. Instead on the Adornments tab there are options to set a single, 
general, country border and sky colours. 
On the beam display options dialog, there is an option to display the beam 
cones. 
The biggest difference between the two dialogs is the addition of an extra tab 
called Viewpoint. This is only applicable to the 3D view where the view point can 
be changed. In the map view this is fixed. 
User Guide 
 
Page 172 
 
 
 
 
Viewpoint Tab 
This tab allows you to set the view position itself. The default option is user 
defined. This allows you to: 
1. Set a specific lat/long/height to view from 
2. Change the view position interactively dragging the globe in the view 
window. 
With the user defined option, you can choose whether you want the earth to 
rotate in the view when the simulation is running. 
The other option allows you to view from a particular station. This allows you to 
sit on a satellite say and see what the world looks like from there – a useful way 
to understand many aspects of the geometry and dynamics of, for example, a 
non-GSO scenario. 
The direction of view is always towards the centre of the earth. 
4.2.3 
Schemes for Map and 3D Views 
A feature of both property dialogs is the option to use schemes. These are 
simply groups of view settings that can be instantly called up. To select a 
scheme, click on the drop-down box at the top of the dialog. The scheme 
contains settings for all the tabs. 
You can create your own schemes. To do this, simply click Save as. You will be 
asked to provide a name for the scheme. Click OK and the scheme will be 
added to the list. You can delete schemes that you have created if you make a 
mistake or you no longer need them. 
4.2.4 
Model View 
An example of the Model View is shown below.  
User Guide 
 
Page 173 
 
 
 
 
Example Model View 
This view has several functions:  
1. To show you the structure of the scenario you have created. The view 
allows you to see, browse and edit the objects that already exist 
2. To create new objects – the view acts as an alternative to the menu bar 
and icon. Clicking the ‘Add’ button (top left) allows you to create new 
objects. 
3. Duplicate and delete buttons allow you to duplicate and delete selected 
objects 
4. Load and Save – this allows you to save objects to a location outside the 
simulation as a text file. You can then edit the text file and re-load or load 
the same object into a new simulation. 
4.2.5 
Watch Window 
The watch window is a way of monitoring the evolution of selected simulation 
variables. Select and order a list of variables and watch as they are interactively 
updated as the simulation runs. 
You can pick Carrier Station, Station Group, Link and Link Group parameters.

Visualyse Simulation Showing Example Use of a Watch Window 
In the example above a Watch Window has been set up to show intersatellite 
C/N and downlink C/N (Link attributes) and the end-to-end C/N (a Link Group 
attribute). The scenario is the downlinking of information from the International 
Space Station to an Earth Station via one of two TDRS satellites 
To create a new Watch Window select New from the Window menu, then pick 
Watch Window from the list. A blank Watch Window (shown below) will be 
created.

To add a variable to click the ‘Modify Watches’, button in the top left. This 
reveals the objects from which you select the variable of interest. 
In the figure below you can see the Carriers, Links, Stations and Link Groups in 
the simulation. The small arrow to the left of each object indicates that there is 
structure contained within the object. Click the arrow to reveal the parameters 
that can be watched. 
 
Watch Window 
The data in the watch window can be copied at any time using the copy button 
at the top right. The copied data can be pasted into other applications in a tab 
delimited form. 
Tip:  
It is a very good idea to use the watch window to look at the wanted and (where 
applicable) worst single interferer link budgets. This allows you to get a good 
idea of what the main issues are, and sanity check the results.  
If you are unsure about why the results are as they are this is a good place to 
start! 
4.2.6 
Table View  
Table View allows you to view multiple parameters across a Group of Links or 
Stations, or from the full Link or Station list in a single Window. 
The example below shows the method for selecting which variables from a 
group of stations to display 
User Guide

Selecting Variables to Show in Table View 
Once the variables are selected, they can be displayed in rows or columns for 
each station. The figure below shows the latitude, longitude and height for 19 
stations in a hexagonal deployment in Europe.

This view gives a spot height profile between any two points on the surface of 
the earth – it is described in the Modules User Guide 
User Guide 
 
Page 177 
 
 
 
4.2.8 
Frequency View 
The frequency view can be used to show graphically the spectrum mask of 
transmitters and the receive filter characteristics, together with the frequency 
offset between them. 
An example is shown in the figure below, taken from the “Digital Dividend” 
example file “3G into DVB Punched Holes.sim”. 
 
Frequency View 
The frequency view shows in the top half the transmit mask in terms of relative 
power in dB against frequency offset from carrier centre frequency. In the 
bottom half, using the same frequency scale, is the attenuation of the receiver in 
dB – again with respect to frequency offset from carrier centre frequency.  
The two frequency scales are aligned to show to scale the relative frequency 
offset of the two links. In addition the central frequencies of the two links are 
displayed above each mask. 
You can open a new frequency view by selecting menu option “Window | New | 
Frequency view” or clicking on the icon 
 
Having done that you can configure it by right clicking within the view to open 
the following dialog: 
User Guide 
 
Page 178 
 
 
 
 
The first step to configure the view is to select the receiver of interest: the RX 
mask shown will use taken from the carrier for this link. The frequency axis of 
the view will have its zero frequency offset defined by this link’s centre 
frequency. 
Then the transmit mask can be defined by one of two ways: 
1. From the carrier of the worst single interfering link into the selected victim 
link 
2. From the carrier of a specific link 
In both the RX mask and TX mask cases if the link is bi-directional it will be 
necessary to select the direction as there could be different carriers and / or 
different frequency offsets between forward / return directions. 
If the TX mask is taken from the RX link’s worst interferer, and the interference 
path has the “Bandwidth adjustment” option set to “Integrate masks” then the 
calculated Bandwidth Advantage will be shown in the view’s bottom left corner. 
The view can be copied into the clipboard for pasting into other applications by 
clicking on the copy icon or selecting menu option “Edit | Copy”. 
Note that this view updates during the simulation, so that if a frequency hopping 
system is used it will show the frequency offsets for the current time step – see 
the “Short Range” example file “WiFi and BT.SIM” 
4.3 
Change Variable Wizard 
The final item under the Model menu is the Change Variable Wizard.  
This allows any parameters of a group of stations or links to be changed to a 
new value, to take random values in a given range, or to vary linearly across the 
group between two values. 
User Guide 
 
Page 179 
 
 
 
The Change Variable Wizard is accessed via the Edit menu. The first screen in 
the Wizard is shown below. 
 
Change Variable Wizard Select Variable 
The two parameter groups on this screen are ‘Container’ and ‘Variable’. The 
‘Container’ defines the object which contains the variable to be changed. This 
object can be chosen from any of the object lists (Station, Link, Beam Type etc,) 
or from any Station Group or Link Group.  
The ‘Variable’ group is used to define the variable to be changed. In the 
example above, the antenna height of all the stations in the Group 
‘Constellation’ will be varied. 
The second screen is shown below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 180 
 
 
 
 
Change Variable Wizard Set Values 
The options in this screen are: 
• 
Set all the variables to the same (user defined) value. 
• 
Spread the variable between two defined bounds - variability can be linear, 
starting at the lower bound for the first variable on the list, or it can be 
random.  
If random is selected then a set of random numbers will be used. For 
repeatability the same set of random numbers will be used each time the 
change variable wizard is run: hence if you want a different set of random 
numbers you must click on the “Seed” button.  
If you do not there will be correlation between sequences, such as in the 
example below where the latitudes and longitudes have been randomized from 
the same seed: 
 
User Guide 
 
Page 181 
 
 
 
The options under ‘Action’ (click the arrow to the right of the button) apply when 
a ‘Single Fixed value’ is selected. The options, which determine how the 
parameter placed in the Value field is used, are: 
• 
Set – this option sets all the parameters to the value input by the user. 
• 
Add – takes the value input and adds it to the current value. This could be 
used to shift a group of stations in Longitude, maintaining the relative 
positions of the Group 
• 
Multiply – take the value input and multiplies the current value.  
Selecting next will finish the Change Variable Wizard and change all the 
selected variables.  
Example applications of the Change Variable Wizard are: 
• 
Randomise the antenna heights in a Group of terrestrial Stations, between 
defined limits. 
• 
Change the power on multiple Links in a Link Group. 
• 
Change the Antenna Type on all the Stations in a large Group. 
• 
Randomise Earth station latitudes and longitudes or antenna azimuths and 
elevations.

Data Analysis  
5.1 
The Output Menu 
The Output menu is where you specify what statistics you would like Visualyse 
to calculate for you and which variables you would like to write into Log file. 
5.1.1 
Visualyse Statistics Collection 
The following parameters are gathered: 
• 
Worst data value and simulation time of worst data value 
• 
Average data value (this is a mean value) 
• 
Standard deviation of range of data values 
• 
Number of events 
• 
Longest event length and time of longest event 
• 
Average event length 
• 
Probability distribution of data values  
The probability distribution is created using an array of bins using the bin size 
specified. Visualyse puts values in the bin by rounding down: hence if the bin 
size is 1 dB and the C/N = 18.3 dB this will be placed in the 18 – 19 dB bin 
which is labelled as 18 dB. 
Where appropriate, Visualyse will calculate statistics in dBs or in absolute value. 
In some cases, the parameter values may be mathematically undefined if they 
are collected and calculated in dB. Visualyse will return values for these 
statistics based on default dB values – for example of there is no signal level (0 
watts) Visualyse defaults to a value of -3000 dBW. 
5.1.1.1 Link Interference Statistics Collection 
Interference statistics collection is specified at simulation level. You choose what 
interference statistics you want to collect and whether these statistics should 
apply to just wanted Links and Link groups or all the Links and Link groups.  
To allow for special cases, can override the document level settings in any Link 
or Link Group object. 
To specify the statistics you wish to collect, select Statistics Collection from the 
Output menu. This will display the Statistics Collection Options dialog. 
User Guide 
 
Page 183 
 
 
 
 
Statistics Collection Options Dialog 
The dialog has two tabs. The first of these is the Link Statistics tab. This allows 
you to choose which Link and Link Group interference parameters you want to 
look at. 
To choose an interference parameter simply check the appropriate box. A 
threshold can then be specified for this parameter. The threshold is used by 
Visualyse to define an interference event when calculating percent time 
interference is seen or the number and length of interference events.  
For PFD and EPFD there are additional options for specifying the reference 
bandwidth. Note that PFD and EPFD cannot be selected at the same time. If 
you switch one on, the other will automatically switch off. 
 
Extra PFD Bandwidth Parameter 
 
Specifying Your Own Bandwidth 
User Guide 
 
Page 184 
 
 
 
The “Calculation Options” button allows you to define whether the statistics for 
each of the standard link metrics are calculated in dB or absolute. For example, 
when calculating the “mean I/N” is it the mean of the I/N in dB or the I/N in 
absolute? 
A separate option allows you to say whether you want to generate histograms 
(probability distribution functions). If this option is chosen, a histogram is created 
for each of the selected interference parameters. The size of the bins (the 
resolution) of these histograms can also be specified. 
Finally, you can choose whether the statistics are collected for all Links and Link 
Groups or just for wanted Links and Link Groups. 
5.1.1.2 User Defined Statistics 
There is a second tab labelled the Advanced tab.  
From this tab you can choose any parameter in the simulation and collect 
statistics on that. 
 
Advanced Tab for User Defined Statistics 
Click the Add button to add a new variable to the list. This will bring up the 
Statistics dialog. 
User Guide 
 
Page 185 
 
 
 
 
Selection of a User Defined Statistical Variable 
The Variable is selected from the Object Tree, a Criterion Level is set and the 
resolution of a probability distribution (if being collected) is defined. 
The Criterion value can be either a maximum or minimum above or below which 
Visualyse will record an event. 
5.1.2 
The Visualyse Log File 
The values of any number of variables can be saved to a Log file at time 
intervals that are user definable. The log file has the same name as the 
simulation file and is in the same directory. Variables can be added to the file at 
the start of each run by selecting ‘Log Data’ from the analysis menu 
A list of currently selected log variables is shown. To add a new variable press 
‘Add’ then the data to be logged can then be selected by navigating the Object 
Tree, to point to the required variable. Note: it is possible to add multiple 
variables at the same time by holding the “Ctrl” key when clicking. 
Data can be logged at each time step or every n time steps, where n is any 
integer. The logging interval is set via the Configure item of the Run menu. 
The resulting log file will contain the values of all the defined variables at each 
required time interval. The log file can be edited using any text editor. The data 
in the file is tab delimited and can be imported into other Windows applications 
such as spreadsheets and word processors. 
The example text below is copied from a log file containing two variables, the 
received power and the antenna elevation at an earth station tracking a non-
GSO constellation

5.2.2 
Graphing 
5.2.2.1 Introduction 
There are three types of graph available in Visualyse: 
User Guide 
 
Page 190 
 
 
 
• 
Data vs. Time Graph - time stepped interactive plot of a variable against 
time  
• 
Distribution Graph - the display of probability distributions, and cumulative 
distributions for interference and user defined statistics. 
• 
Data vs. Data Graph - the display of any two variables on an XY scatter 
plot. 
Graphs are created from the Results menu or from the toolbar icons: 
 
5.2.2.2 Data vs. Time 
A Data vs. Time graph allows up to six variables in the simulation to be watched 
as they evolve with time. The Data vs. Time graph dialog can be invoked by 
selecting the Data vs. Time graph item from the Analysis Menu, or by a mouse 
click on the Data vs. Time graph icon, 
, on the main toolbar. 
The Data vs. Time graph definition dialog is shown below. 
 
Data vs. Time Graph Variable Selection 
The number of time steps to be displayed can be changed in the top left of the 
dialog. The default is 50; the upper limit imposed by Visualyse is 1000.  
An option to automatically scale the Y-axis can be selected at the top right of the 
dialog. This will continually adjust the Y axis range, based on the range of data 
values in the plotted data set. 
User Guide 
 
Page 191 
 
 
 
If the automatic axis scaling option is not chosen, the minimum and maximum 
expected values must be specified. These default to values that depend on the 
type of variable to be plotted and on the current value of that variable. For 
example, in the case of C/I 60 dB is considered to be a reasonable range. If 
Data vs. Time graph is invoked when the value is 25 dB, the default maximum 
and minimum expected values will be 55 B and -5 dB. 
The best option here is for the user to define maximum and minimum expected 
values based on experience or an understanding of the problem. 
The ‘Set Markers’ button allows markers or lines to be added to graphs at 
defined fixed points. On a Data vs. Time graph this can be used to add a line at 
a reference, threshold value, as shown in the example below. 
 
Example Data vs. Time Graph  
Up to six variables can be simultaneously plotted. Select the number of plots 
required then set the variable for each plot via the ‘Set Plot n’ button. 
To select the variable to be plotted, click the ‘Set Plot’ button. You can then 
choose to plot Link parameters, or any other variable selected from the 
simulation object tree.

5.2.2.3 Data vs. Data Graph 
The Data vs. Data graph can be used to display up to three pairs of variables on 
a scatter plot. An example would be to plot an antenna azimuth and elevation on 
the same graph for a tracking antenna. Handover of the Link to another station 
would appear as a discontinuity on the plot. 
The Data vs. Data graph dialog is invoked by selecting Data vs. Data graph from 
the Analysis menu, or clicking the Data vs. Data graph icon, 
, on the toolbar. 
 
Data vs. Data Configuration 
The ‘Number of time steps’ to plot and the ranges to use for each axis are 
inputs. The axes ranges can be automatically selected based on the range of 
values in the data set at each time step. If the Auto Scale option is not chosen 
the maximum and minimum required values need to be specified 
Parameters of each plot are selected via the ‘Set Plot’ button. This brings up the

Area Analysis 
Visualyse includes a powerful feature for area analysis that is both quick and 
simple to use.  
Area Analysis allows you to produce colour coded block plot or contours of Link 
or Station parameters and of the statistics of these parameters. 
In outline, you simply define the area you are interested in and Visualyse will ask 
for a template Link (or Station) to use as a test probe at every point (down to a 
user defined resolution) within the area to work out the parameter you want to 
analyse. 
There is also an alternative method called “Advanced Contouring” to produce 
contours using groups of stations and links as described in the last sub-section. 
5.3.1 
Creating the Analysis 
Area analysis is started by selecting ‘Create and Area Analysis’ from the Results 
menu or clicking the  icon on the toolbar, or by selecting the Area Analysis 
Manager from the Results menu. 
The simplest way to create a new Area Analysis is to click the icon - you can 
then draw out the area on the map using the mouse. Drag the mouse from the 
top left to the bottom right of the area of interest.  
When you release the mouse you will be prompted to select a Link to use as 
your template, and will have to select the parameter to analyse, as in the figure 
below. 
User Guide 
 
Page 201 
 
 
 
 
Area Analysis Properties dialog 
The Area Analysis properties page has the following parameters: 
• 
Name 
• 
Coordinates – if you have defined the area by drag and drop, the 
coordinates of the corners will be shown here and can be edited 
• 
Moving station – one station must move in over the defined area. If you are 
looking at something like coverage analysis, this Station will be the receive 
station. If you are looking at interference levels it would be victim station. If 
you are looking at exclusion zones, it would probably be the interfering 
station. 
• 
Plot parameter – select here the variable to be displayed in the Area 
Analysis for each location of the moving station  
• 
Adjustment during run – this allows the field to display to take account of 
the simulation run, so that either the value for the current time step at each 
time step is shown or the min / max / mean over all time steps at each point 
is shown. 
User Guide

• 
Plotting options – as described in the following section  
• 
Control to suspend drawing at each simulation update (including time step) 
to improve performance 
• 
Control to suspend drawing of the Area Analysis title bar. 
You can re-size the Area Analysis by clicking on the “Select Mode” icon on the 
toolbar and then dragging and dropping one of the corners or edges of the Area 
Analysis Rectangle. 
5.3.2 
Area Analysis Plot Options  
You can plot the area analysis as a grid of coloured blocks (block plot) or as a 
series of contours (contour plot). Examples of these are shown below. 
 
Area Analysis - Contours 
User Guide

Area Analysis Block Plot  
The number of kilometres between test points defines the resolution of the 
analysis. You can set this from the dialog. 
5.3.3 
Display Settings 
The display settings depend on the type of plot you select. 
5.3.3.1 Block Plot Display Settings 
A block plot shows the variation in the chosen link parameter by plotting a block 
of colour at each test point. The display settings allow you to determine how the 
blocks are coloured, what ranges to plot and how the plot is rendered. The

Display Settings for Block Plots 
You can press the ‘Add’ button to add new levels and then: 
• 
Type in the value in the first column 
• 
Select the colour from the colour select control at the top right. 
The left side of the dialog shows a preview of how the colours will appear on 
your plot. Calculated results between value entries in the table will result in a 
colour blended between the nearest two colour entries. 
There is also a field to enable display of a legend on the map offset to one side 
of the Area Analysis, as in the figure below showing example file “PMR 
Coverage” from the “Network Coverage” example files. 
 
Area Analysis Block Plot Legend 
Colour Selection Tip 1: to create a map from ranges of values to a single 
colour, include two entries, one for the start and end of the required range. So in 
the example above yellow is used for C/Ns between 5 and 10. The first is offset 
User Guide 
 
Page 205 
 
 
 
slightly to 5.1 so it is greater than the end of the previous range, which is that 
C/Ns between -10 and 5 should be in red. 
Colour Selection Tip 2: it is possible, and often useful, to set colour as “Don’t 
draw”. This can be useful to show in colour where criteria such as coverage is 
met and no colour where there is no coverage. 
5.3.3.2 Contour Display Settings 
Contour plots show the variation of the link parameter across the area as a set 
of contours. Because there are only a discrete number of contours, you can set 
their levels and colours individually. The display settings dialog for contour plots 
is shown below. 
 
Contour Display Settings 
You can show up to ten different contour levels on your plot. These are shown 
on the left of the dialog. To set the level for a particular contour, simply enter a 
value for it in the appropriate box. 
To change the line style or colour of a particular contour, click on the line style 
control. 
User Guide 
 
Page 206 
 
 
 
 
Edit Line Style and Colour 
You can switch off contours by clicking on the appropriate check boxes. 
If you want to display several contours between two levels, set the top and 
bottom contour levels to the extreme values and click “Space levels evenly” to 
automatically set the levels for the contours in between. 
If you are not sure what the likely range of values will be in your plot, click 
“Suggest levels”. This will establish the likely range of values and fill in the 
contour levels with suitable values. 
You can choose whether to show a label for each contour. The font for the 
contour labels can also be changed. 
You can save your contour settings as schemes for use another time. A number 
of schemes are supplied with the software. The values at the levels are not 
saved as these are highly dependent on the individual plot. 
5.3.4 
Area Analysis Pop-Up Menu 
There are additional controls in a pop-up menu: to activate this right click on the 
Area Analysis. 
User Guide 
 
Page 207 
 
 
 
 
Area Analysis Pop-up Menu 
This gives additional options for the Area Analysis including: 
• 
Export data: save the data as a comma separated values (CSV) text file for 
additional analysis 
• 
Export population data: save in CSV format the population associated with 
each of the contour or threshold levels defined under Area Properties. This 
requires the population data directory be set as in Section Error! R
eference source not found. 
• 
Bitmap: saves the image produced by the Area Analysis as a bitmap 
• 
KML: exports data from the simulation including the Area Analysis to be 
displayed in Google Earth (see section 5.4) 
• 
Delete: deletes the selected Area Analysis 
• 
Suspend on/off: stops re-calculation of the Area Analysis every time the 
simulation is updated. This is useful for calculations that take a long time to 
complete. Remember to un-suspend to show the results! 
• 
Area Properties: opens the Area Analysis configuration dialog as described 
in section 5.3.1 
• 
View Properties: opens the view configuration dialog as described in 
section 4.2 
Tip:  It is often useful to create Area Analysis that do not completely overlap so that it 
is possible to right click on each to open this list of options. However remember

the Area Analysis Manager (see following section) can be used to open the 
properties of any Area Analysis – even those covered by others. 
5.3.5 
Area Analysis Management and Display 
All the Area Analysis defined for the current simulation can be accessed via the 
Area Analysis list, accessed via the Results menu option “Area Analysis 
Manager”. 
The dialog allows control on the Area Analysis, including buttons to: 
• 
Add 
•

Area Analysis List 
Any of the Area Analysis can be shown on any map or 3D view where they are 
controlled via the overlays tab on the view properties: see section 4.2.1.3 for 
more information. 
5.3.6 
Advanced Contouring using Groups 
This section describes an alternative way to generate contours using a grid of 
stations and associated links. 
It is accessed via the properties dialog of: 
• 
Map Views (Mercator or Plate Carrée) 
• 
3D View 
On the view properties dialog on the first or “Features” tab there is an “Options” 
button under “Advanced Contouring”. If you click on this you will be able to 
configure the contours using the following two pages: 
User Guide 
 
Page 209 
 
 
 
 
Advanced Contouring: Contour Definition 
 
Advanced Contouring: Contour Display 
To make this form of contouring work you must: 
1) Create a grid of test points using the Station Group Service Area Wizard. 
This can define the service area by {Region, Beam footprint, or Country} but 
not {Locations or Hexagonal Cells}. On the final page the option selected 
must be to fill the area with stations in a grid defined by a number (North, 
East). 
User Guide 
 
Page 210 
 
 
 
2) For each of these stations create a link using the “Link to Station Group” 
Wizard. Often this is a Receive Link but it could be Fixed Link or even under 
some circumstances a Dynamic Link. However, it cannot be a Transmit Link. 
3) Configure the rest of the simulation including any other stations, links and 
interference paths. 
Having done these three steps there will be a Link Group which has an 
associated station (either the start or end station) which is one of a grid of test 
points. It is therefore possible to associate a value from any of the link calculated 
values for each point on that grid and then contour it. 
It is often useful to check that the values are as expected for one or two links 
using the standard Watch window.  
When the simulation has been configured, it is possible to define the contours to 
display using the two dialogs above. This is done in two stages: 
1) Define the Data to Contour 
The data to contour is defined using the “Contour Definition” dialog shown in the 
figure above, and consists of: 
• 
Select of group to use: this is usually a link group which have stations 
at one end that are in a regular grid 
• 
Select whether to display a Station attribute (such as elevation or 
azimuth angles) or Link attribute (many of them, including C, I, C/I, 
C/(N+I), I/N etc) 
• 
Select the object and variable from it to display: this is similar to the 
selection of a variable in the Watch window. 
• 
Select the link direction (either Forward = Start to End or Return = 
End to Start) and then whether the grid of test points is the 
transmitter or receive station for the selected link direction. 
It is also possible to define a minimum distance: this feature could, for example, 
be used to define a minimum coordination distance for Mode 1 or Mode 2 
contours derived using RR Appendix S.7. 
2) Define how the Data is to be Displayed 
The contour levels and labelling is selected using the “Contour Display” dialog 
shown in the figure above. 
This dialog is similar to the controls used to select beam or link levels on the 
view properties dialog. 
Area Analysis vs Advanced Contouring 
In general the Area Analysis tool is much more flexible and results in smaller 
simulation files that are quicker to load. 
There are a few cases where it can be more useful to use the Advanced 
Contouring option. One is shown in the figure below, where by the grid of test 
points are all within the area defined by a polygon (in this case France) rather 
than a square that could include other countries or the sea. 
User Guide 
 
Page 211 
 
 
 
 
Advanced Contouring: Example Output 
In this example a grid of test points with France has been used to generate a 
contour of locations where a 50 dBW transmitter at a height of 100 m would just 
meet a PFD threshold on the sea or land boundaries of France.

Interface to Google Earth 
There are two places in Visualyse where provides an interface to Google Earth. 
The first is on the File menu, the second is via the pop-up menu you get if you 
right click on any of the map or 3D views. 
5.4.1 
Export items using File Menu Option 
When a 2D or 3D map views is active, the File menu gives you the option to 
‘Export to Google Earth …’.  
Click on this option and the following dialog appears: 
User Guide 
 
Page 212 
 
 
 
 
Export to Google Earth Options 
You can selective export all the Advanced Contours, Area Analyses, Beams, 
Links and Station Icons (together with their locations) from the current 
simulation. 
Define the file location and Visualyse produces a .KMZ file: by default this will be 
in the same location as the sim file. 
If the final box is checked, Google Earth will be launched automatically when the 
file export is complete (assuming it has been installed). 
5.4.2 
Export items using Pop-up Menu 
If you right click on either of the map views or the 3D view outside of an Area 
Analysis, you will get a pop-up menu as shown below: 
 
Export to Google Earth Pop-Up Menu-1 
If you select “Export to Google Earth…” you will get the same dialog as above, 
and can use that to create a KMZ file and start Google Earth automatically. 
If you right click on either of the map views or the 3D view inside of an Area 
Analysis, you will get a pop-up menu as shown below: 
User Guide 
 
Page 213 
 
 
 
 
Export to Google Earth Pop-Up Menu-2 
There is an option here, “KML”, that allows you to generate the KML file that can 
be used later by Google Earth. 
5.4.3 
Managing Data within Google Earth 
Google Earth allows you to view your data in 3D overlaid upon standard 
geographical information including satellite photos, roads, railways etc. 
For example if you export the demonstration file “PMR Coverage.sim” from the 
“Network coverage” directory, Visualyse will export: 
• 
Two stations, the base station and the mobile station 
• 
One Area Analysis, showing the predicted C/N 
These are grouped together in a tree, and each item can be shown or hidden 
within Google Earth by clicking on the check box, as in the figure below: 
 
Grouping of Visualyse Objects in Google Earth 
Google Earth can then display the required images, such as:

Background on Google Earth 
More information about the features and background to Google Earth including 
downloads can be found at: 
http://earth.google.com/ 
A number of versions are available which at time of press included one free to 
use for non-commercial usage and another requiring minor fee for commercial 
use.  
Note that the functionality and licensing of Google Earth could be modified by 
Google in the future. 
Question: Why are Google Earth files called KMZ? 
Answer:  The program is based upon tools used to view images generated by the 
Keyhole satellite program, and a Markup languages was created to add 
overlays. In addition the files are Zipped to reduce their size.
